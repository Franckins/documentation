Teams are created from your Account Page. The teams you manage are accessed by toggling a
drop-down menu on your account user name. You can add members and choose their permissions from the Members tab on the teamâ€™s account page.

Team Libraries are more versatile than shared Libraries because they can have more than one account administrator.

You need to have a Team Account in order to create teams. You can upgrade to a Team Account from the **Billing** tab on your account Page.
