You need to have a Team Account in order to create teams.  You can upgrade to a Team Account from the Billing Tab on your Account Page.

Teams are created from your Account Page.  The teams you manage are accessed by toggling a 
drop-down menu on your account user name.  You can add members and choose their permissions from the Members tab on the teamâ€™s account page.

Team Libraries are more versatile than shared Libraries because they can have more than one account administrator.

Teams display on the Libraries Page sidebar under Shared Libraries.
