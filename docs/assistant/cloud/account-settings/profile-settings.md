Your public profile is part of the Assistant Pro Community. Access public profile settings from the **Assistant Pro Cloud dashboard > Account > General**. If you don't want to make my profile available to the community, it can be disabled. By default it is enabled.

Your public profile is assigned a file structure that utilizes your username. This example is for the community member [@paullacey](https://app.assistant.pro/community/user/paullacey).
