The Collection feature lets you organize your library assets similar to how WordPress post tags work. Organizing asset files this way is preferable to creating folders, because files can be referred to multiple places.

## Assign to multiple Collections

Any creative asset (posts, pages, images, etc.) can be assigned to more than one collection, and it will appear under each collection. Organizing files this way is preferable to creating folders, because files can be referred to multiple places.

For another example, you might want to group your color assets into collections. In the image below, the color `#ede2f1` is filed under two collections; **Pastel Colors** and **Pink Colors**.
