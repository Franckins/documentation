## Utilizing Content Created by the Assistant Pro Community

You can either subscribe to an Assistant Pro Community Library or duplicate it.

* **Subscribe** to a library if you’d like to get updates and see continually added content.
* **Duplicate** a library to have the ability to easily import the whole library.

* **Subscriptions** are filed under shared libraries in the sidebar and are owned by the library’s creator.
* **Duplicated libraries** are filed under your libraries and you have ownership.
