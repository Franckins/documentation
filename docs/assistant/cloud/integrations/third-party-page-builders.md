In addition to Beaver Builder, the Assistant Pro Cloud platform allows you to add content from other mainstream page builders including Gutenberg, Divi, and Elementor.

To add 3rd party page builder content, simply add posts and pages with the 3rd party pagebuilder layouts to your libraries using the content app or libraries app.
