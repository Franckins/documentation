Assistant Pro’s Library Collections work in a similar way to WordPress post categories. You can add more than one collection to any creative asset (posts, pages, images …) and that creative asset will show up under each collection. This way of organizing files is preferred over folders, because files can be cross referenced in multiple places.

In the example below, the color `#ede2f1` is filed under two collections; **Pastel Colors** and **Pink Colors**.

## Sort by Collection from the Assistant Pro Cloud

​​By default libraries are sorted by file type.  Once you have added collections, you can also sort by collection.
