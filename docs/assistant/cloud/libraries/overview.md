Libraries are collections of [creative assets](/assistant/overview.md/#creative-assets). There are two sources for the creative assets in libraries:

* Those shared by the Assistant Pro Cloud Community.  
* Those assigned to libraries from any of your websites with the Assistant WordPress Plugin installed.

Libraries can be created in either the Assistant Pro Cloud or in the Assistant plugin.


You can add colors and images (.jpg, .png, .svg .giff) as well as templates shared by the community to your libraries from the Assistant Pro Cloud.
