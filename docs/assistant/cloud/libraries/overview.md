You can add colors and images (.jpg, .png, .svg .giff) as well as templates shared by the community to your libraries from the Assistant Pro Cloud.  

You can add images, colors, theme settings, and page content (posts, pages, Gutenberg Blocks and Beaver Builder Saved Content) to libraries from the Assistant WordPress Plugin.  

Assistant also supports the templates and saved content of most popular page editors including Divi, Visual Composer and Elementor.
