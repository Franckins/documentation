To share a library, select the share tab, then enter the email address and select the permissions you want to give the person you're sharing with.Another way to share files is by using a Team Account.  Team Libraries are more versatile than shared libraries because more than one person can be an administrator.

To share a library, navigate into the library you want to share and click the share button.
