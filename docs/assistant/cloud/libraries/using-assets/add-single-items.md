How you add single items from a library to a website depends on the type of [creative asset](../../../overview.md#creative-assets) you're adding.

## Content

1. Navigate to the piece of content youâ€™d like to import to your site from the Libraries app.
2. Select **Create and Edit** or **Import** from the **Create New** drop-down menu.
	* **Create and Edit** imports the content and opens it for editing.
	* **Import** adds the content to the backend of your site and the [Content App](../../../plugin/apps/content.md).
