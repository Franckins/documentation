Assistant Pro Cloud lets you organize [creative assets](../overview.md#creative-assets) in [libraries](../overview.md#library) and [collections](../overview.md#library-collections) so you can share them across your websites, by means of the Assistant plugin, or share them with the Assistant Pro Community.

## Creative Assets

Creative assets include the following:

* Images (.png .jpg .svg .gif)
* Content, such as posts, pages, Beaver Builder saved content, Themer layouts, WooCommerce content, and Gutenberg blocks
* Colors
* Theme Customizer Settings

## Libraries

Libraries are containers for your creative assets. Libraries make it easy to share assets across all your sites. Libraries can be:

* Private or Public (Private libraries are only available on Premium accounts)
* Personal, Shared, or Team (Team Libraries are only available for Team account users)

## Collections

Collections are a way to organize your libraries. They function in a similar way to WordPress categories.
