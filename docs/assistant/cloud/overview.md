Assistant Pro allows us to organize creative assets in libraries and collections so we can easily access them from the Assistant WordPress Plugin when weâ€™re building sites.

## Creative Assets

Creative assets are the things you put inside Libraries.  

* Images (.png .jpg .svg .giff)
* Content (Posts, Pages, Beaver Builder Saved Content, Themer Layouts, WooCommerce Content, Gutenberg blocks...)
* Colors
* Theme Customizer Settings

## Libraries

Libraries are containers for your creative assets.  Libraries allow you to easily share assets across all your sites. Libraries can be:

* Public
* Personal
* Private
* Shared
* Team

## Collections

Collections are a way to organize your libraries. Similar to how categories work in WordPress.
