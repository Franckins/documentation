Assistant Pro allows us to organize creative assets in libraries and collections so we can easily access them from the Assistant WordPress Plugin when weâ€™re building sites.

## Creative Assets

Creative assets include the following:

* Images (.png .jpg .svg .gif)
* Content, such as posts, pages, Beaver Builder saved content, Themer layouts, WooCommerce content, and Gutenberg blocks
* Colors
* Theme Customizer Settings

## Libraries

Libraries are containers for your creative assets. Libraries make it easy to share assets across all your sites. Libraries can be:

* Public
* Personal
* Private
* Shared
* Team

## Collections

Collections are a way to organize your libraries. Similar to how categories work in WordPress.
