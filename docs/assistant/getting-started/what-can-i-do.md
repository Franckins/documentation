Assistant Pro is a cloud sharing application that will help you keep your WordPress assets organized and easily accessible.  It links to your WordPress sites using a plugin.  The plugin offers a suite of apps that let you perform common tasks using a frontend sidebar.


## Assistant WordPress Plugin

Allows you to perform common WordPress tasks more efficiently using a sidebar on the frontend of your website.

## Assistant Pro Cloud

A cloud storage platform that connects to the WordPress sites you’ve installed the Assistant WordPress plugin on.  It allows you to easily access, share and organize design assets across multiple sites.  It’s kinda like a “Dropbox” for WordPress assets.
















:::note
Assistant’s functionality is extended by using other Beaver Builder products, but Assistant also works on non-Beaver-Builder sites too.
