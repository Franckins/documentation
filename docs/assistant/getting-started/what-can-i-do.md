Assistant Pro is a cloud sharing application that helps you keep your WordPress assets organized and easily accessible.  It links to your WordPress sites using a plugin. The plugin offers a suite of apps that perform common tasks using a frontend sidebar.

## Assistant WordPress Plugin

The Assistant plugin allows you to connect your sites to your libraries in Assistant Pro. It also works as a stand alone application that allows you to perform common tasks from the frontend of your WordPress sites using an expandable sidebar. For instance:

* Browse and edit page content and media.
* Browse and edit WooCommerce products, orders and coupons.
* Update and manage plugins.
* Review comments for approval/spam/trash.
* Import and export content to between sites using the Assistant Pro Cloud.

:::note
You don’t need to use the Assistant Pro Cloud to enjoy the WordPress plugin. The Assistant Pro Cloud extends the uses of the WordPress plugin.
