The Content App is where you can view and edit content like posts, pages, Beaver Builder templates, WooCommerce products and Gutenberg blocks.  Other popular page builders such as Elementor and Divi are also supported by Assistant Pro. 

You can also add content to the Assistant Pro Cloud from the Content App.

Once you click on a piece of content, you are given the opportunity to perform various actions such as add labels, view post, launch Beaver Builder, save to Assistant Pro library, mark as favorite, edit in WordPress admin, duplicate, export, and move to trash.
