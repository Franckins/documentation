From the media app, you can browse and sort media or upload new media. You can also add media to the Assistant Pro Cloud from the Media App. See [Adding Content From the Media App](../../cloud/libraries/adding-assets/assistant-plugin.md#add-content-via-the-media-app) for details.

Once you have clicked onto a piece of media, you can see file info like size, file type and upload date. You can also perform various actions such as **View Attachment**, **Save to Library**, **Edit in Admin** and **Delete**.
