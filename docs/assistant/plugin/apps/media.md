## Browser & Sort Media

You can browse and sort media using the filters located at the top of the **Media App**. You can sort by the following:

* **Type** - Filter by **All**, **Photo**, **Document**, **Video** and **Audio**.
* **Display As** - Arrange media items in a **List** or **Grid** (Default) layout.
* **Label** - Filter media items by label.
* **Sort By** - Sort media items by **ID**, **Date Uploaded** (Default) or **Last Modified**.
* **Order** - Sort by Ascending or Descending (Default).

You can restore the filters to default using the **Reset Filters** button.

## Upload Media

The Media App allows you to add .jpg, .png, and .svg graphics to Assistant. In the WordPress media library, .svg graphics are not supported by default, but the Assistant Plugin adds .svg graphics without the need for a third-party plugin or custom code.

1. Open the **Media App**.
2. Click the **Plus** (+) icon.
3. Choose files or drop the file onto the box to upload.

## Edit Media

You can edit media by clicking the media item. From here, you can view file information, such as **File Type**, **Size**, and **Upload Date**, by clicking a media item. Other actions include:

* **Edit Meta Data** - Edit the media items **Title**, **Alternative Text** and **Description**.
* **View Attachment** - This will take you to the attachments page, for example `https://my-website.com?attachment_id=100`.
* **Save to Library** - Adds the media item to a library.
* **Edit in Admin** - This will take you to the edit media page in the WordPress Admin Dashboard.
