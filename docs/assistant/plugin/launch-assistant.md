The Assistant WordPress plugin adds a sidebar to the frontend pages of your site. The sidebar lets you easily perform tasks that you would normally need to access from the backend of your site. You toggle the sidebar on by clicking the floating pencil icon in the upper right corner of your siteâ€™s frontend pages:

<video autoPlay loop>
<source src="/video/assistant/apps--apps-overview.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
<source src="/video/assistant/apps--apps-overview.webm" type="video/webm" />
</video>
