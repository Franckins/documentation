You can choose how menus open when you click the Hamburger icon or MENU label: a dropdown or a flyout animation. This setting is located at **Customize > Header > Nav layout > Responsive nav layout**.

## Responsive menu dropdown

By default in the Beaver Builder Theme, when you click the Hamburger icon or the Menu label, a dropdown menu appears below the header, as shown in the following screenshot on a mobile device. The dropdown menu pushes down the page content as it opens.

There are several settings in the **Responsive nav layout** field on the **Customizer > Header > Nav Layout**
tab, which offer the following flyout animations when you click the hamburger or Menu icon.

  * Dropdown (default)
  * Flyout overlay
  * Flyout push
  * Flyout push with opacity

There's also a new **Responsive nav layout position** field, which lets you
choose whether the flyout occurs from the left or the right.

### Flyout overlay

With **Flyout overlay**, the menu flies in from the left or right (depending on the **Responsive nav layout position** setting), and overlays the main screen with a semi-opaque background, as shown in the following screenshot.

### Flyout push

With **Flyout push**, the menu flies in from the left or right (depending on the **Responsive nav layout position** setting), but pushes the main screen to the side, as shown in the following screenshot, where **Responsive nav layout position** is set to **Left**.

### Flyout push with opacity

With **Flyout push with opacity**, the menu animation is the same as for **Flyout push** but additional the main screen has a semi-opaque dark overlay, as shown in the following screenshot.
