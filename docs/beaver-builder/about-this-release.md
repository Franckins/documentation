Here are the new features in Beaver Builder 2.4.

## Four new modules

Premium versions of Beaver Builder 2.4 have four new modules:

* [Button Group module](/beaver-builder/layouts/modules/button-group.md)
* [List module](/beaver-builder/layouts/modules/list.md)
* [Login form](/beaver-builder/layouts/modules/login-form.md)
* [Search](/beaver-builder/layouts/modules/search.md)

## Existing module improvements

* [Video module](/beaver-builder/layouts/modules/video/video.md)  
  There are new options to show the video in a lightbox, hide player controls, and allow sticky positioning when the video plays on a page.
* [Subscribe Form module](/beaver-builder/layouts/modules/subscribe-form/subscribe-form.md#supported-services)  
  Groundhogg appears in the list of supported services when the GroundHogg plugin is activated.
* [Contact Form module](/beaver-builder/layouts/modules/contact-form/contact-form.md)  
  You can choose to display only form labels, only placeholder text, or both.
* [WooCommerce module](/beaver-builder/layouts/modules/woocommerce.md#display-categories)  
  You can now sort and include specific category IDs.

## Beaver Builder Lite improvements

Three modules have been added to the free version of Beaver Builder:

* [Heading](/beaver-builder/layouts/modules/heading.md)
* [Icon](/beaver-builder/layouts/modules/icon-and-icon-group.md)
* [Button](/beaver-builder/layouts/modules/button/button.md)

In addition, prebuilt layout templates have been added to the free version. See [this article](/beaver-builder/layouts/templates/layout-templates-overview.md) for an overview of how to work with layout templates. Note that in the free version you can't save or export custom layout templates.

## Accessibility improvements

The following accessibility changes and improvements have been made:

* Added a **Screen reader text** field to all modules that allow icon selection, which assists screen readers in describing the icon correctly. See the article about [Icon and Icon Group modules](/beaver-builder/layouts/modules/icon-and-icon-group.md#icon-module) for an example of the HTML output.
* Added labels to the [Subscribe Form module](/beaver-builder/layouts/modules/subscribe-form/subscribe-form.md#accessibility).
* [Contact Form module](/beaver-builder/layouts/modules/contact-form/contact-form.md): Added an `aria-describedby` attribute to each input field to assist screenreaders in describing the purpose of the field. Allow both the spacebar and Enter keys to submit the form.
* Removed blank lines from the [Callout Module](/beaver-builder/layouts/modules/callout-and-call-to-action.md).
* Testimonials Module: Controls were flipped so the markup matches the display.

## Other improvements

* New **Embedded code** option in row backgrounds.  
  This features lets you embed HTML and shortcode. See [the article about working with rows](/beaver-builder/layouts/rows/work-with-rows.md#background-section).
* Added `<main>` to the list of row/column/module container tag options on the **Advanced** tab.  
The **Advanced** tab is documented [here](/beaver-builder/layouts/advanced-tab-for-rows-columns-modules.md).
* Added SpinupWP to the [cache clearing tool](/beaver-builder/troubleshooting/debugging/cache-clearing-tool.md).
