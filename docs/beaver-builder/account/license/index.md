This article explains precisely what Beaver Builder licenses do, how to find them, and how to activate them.

## What is a License?

When you purchase a Beaver Builder premium license (Standard, Pro, Agency, or Ultimate), you receive a license key that is unique to your account. Your license is valid for one year and allows you access to support and all updates released during that time.

:::info
License keys for Beaver Builder are product-specific.

As an example, if you purchase Beaver Builder Standard, your license key is only valid for the version you purchased, and cannot be used with other Beaver Builder versions (Ultimate, Agency, or Pro).

See the [Downgrade](downgrade.md) and [Upgrade](upgrade.md) articles for more information.
