## New Responsive Editing Experience

Prior to Beaver Builder 2.7, the responsive editor provided an approximation of how your website would look on a mobile device and worked similarly to resizing a browser window. The new responsive editor uses an iframe. This should provide a better user experience, not only in terms of accuracy, but also in terms of ease of use.

### Features

* Preview all device sizes (Extra large, large, medium, and small).
* You can set a custom height and width in pixels.
* Zoom (100%, 75%, 50%, and Fit to Window).
* You can resize the editor window by dragging it from the top, bottom, left, or right.
