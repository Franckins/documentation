WordPress 5 uses the block editor (also called the Standard
Editor or Gutenberg editor) by default. If you want to use the Classic Editor, in other words the WordPress editor that existed before the block editor, you have to install a plugin to restore it. This article contains
the instructions for accessing the Beaver Builder editor from both the
WordPress block editor and the classic editor UI, and from other locations in
the WordPress admin panel or admin bar.

:::note **Note**
We've found
that both the [Classic Editor](https://wordpress.org/plugins/classic-editor/) and the [Disable Gutenberg](https://wordpress.org/plugins/disable-gutenberg/) plugins work with Beaver Builder. Most of the other plugins are untested but would be expected to work. If you are using a third-party plugin to restore the classic editor and have a problem, please file a Beaver Builder Support ticket so that we can document the problem and any possible workarounds, or list it as incompatible.

:::note **Note**
By default, the Beaver Builder editor is enabled for page layouts only. You can [enable posts and custom post types in the Beaver Builder settings](/beaver-builder/management-migration/control-which-post-types-can-use-beaver-builder.md).

## 1\. From the WordPress editing page (block or classic)

### 1.1 From the WordPress Block Editor

When you create a page or open an existing page in the WordPress block editor,
you'll see the choice of **Launch Beaver Builder** or Use Standard Editor, as shown in the following screenshot.

### 1.2 In the Classic Editor UI

Create a new page  and click the **Beaver Builder** tab or open an existing page for editing in WordPress and click **Launch Beaver Builder** on the **Beaver Builder** tab, as in the following screenshot.

:::note **Note**
If you're using the Classic Editor plugin and don't see the **Beaver Builder** tab, one way to make it
appear is to force the use of Classic editor rather than the WordPress block editor.
On the WordPress admin panel, go to **Settings > Writing** and select **No**
for **Allow users to switch editors**. If you want users to continue to have a
choice of WordPress editor for each page or post they create, use any of the
other methods described here to open the Beaver Builder editor.

## 2 From the **All Pages** list

:::tip **Tip**
When a Beaver Builder layout already exists for a page, the Beaver
Builder link is followed by a green button, as you can see in the screenshot.
When a Beaver Builder layout hasn't been created yet, it's followed by a pale
gray or white button.

## 3 From the WordPress admin bar

If you're viewing a page and you're logged in, the WordPress admin bar appears
on a large screen, and you can click the **Beaver Builder** link to edit the
page.

When a Beaver Builder layout already exists for the page, the Beaver Builder
link is followed by a green button, as you can see in the screenshot. When a
Beaver Builder layout hasn't been created yet, it's followed by a pale gray
button.

:::tip **Tip**
After the page is open for editing in Beaver Builder, you can watch a
video with tips on how to create a layout. Click the down arrow in the title
bar in the upper left corner of the editing page to expose the **Tools** menu.
Choose **Help** and then start the video that's displayed.
