The Outline panel provides a bird's eye view of all the content on your layout and a streamlined interface to edit and interact with layout content.

## Usage

Attempting to drag a row from "below the fold" on a long page could always be a bit agonizing. The Outline panel makes it easy to rearrange content on large pages and to quickly jump around and edit different parts of a page.

## Access Outline Panel

Click the Outline icon in the **Top Bar** to open the Outline panel, which lets you view and modify the structure of your page layout in an outline format:

:::tip **Tip**
The Outline panel doesn't have a drag handle, but you can remove its overlap on the layout with this trick. First display the Content panel and the [use the drag handle to pin it to the right of the layout](content-panel.md#drag-handle), then click the Outline panel icon. It then overlays the Content panel.

## Expand/Collapse

You can Expand (show) and Collapse (hide) all items using the Outline Panel actions menu item (<i className="fas fa-ellipsis-h"></i> Ellipsis icon).

:::tip
By using persistent storage, the Outline Panel keeps track of what sections have been expanded and collapsed.

## Keyboard Shortcut

Using the Outline Panel's keyboard shortcuts, you can open and close the Outline Panel as well as expand and collapse the tree view.

* **Expand or Collapse the Tree View** - <kbd>Shift</kbd> & <kbd>T</kbd>

## Navigate

Click once in any entry in the Outline panel to scroll to that element in the layout. Click twice to open that element's settings.

## Move Content

You can quickly move content such as rows, columns (except for child columns), and modules within the Outline Panel using drag-and-drop.

## Right-Click

Right-click any entry to see a list of available options.

* Rows and columns have **Open settings** and **Remove** options.
* Modules have **Open settings**, **Duplicate**, and **Remove** options.

## Labels

You can [add a label via the **Advanced** tab](advanced-tab/html-element.md#label) of a row, column, or module that helps to identify its purpose in Outline view. In the following screenshot, the Outline panel shows the label **Page Title** that was added to a Heading module for the setting **Advanced > HTML Element > Label**.
