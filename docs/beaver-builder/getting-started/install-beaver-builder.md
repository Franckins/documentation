## Download the Beaver Builder plugin

Download the Beaver Builder plugin zip from the My Account page.

:::note **Note**
If you're a Mac/Safari user and the download shows up as a folder instead of a zip file, you won't be able to install, because WordPress requires uploading a zip file. See [this article](/beaver-builder/troubleshooting/common-issues/i-cant-upload-the-installer-zip-file-because-it-is-unzipped-when-i-download.md) for the fix.

## Deactivate and delete existing Beaver Builder plugins

If you are upgrading from the lite version of Beaver Builder, or from one paid version to another, deactivate and delete the existing plugin on your WordPress site. You won't lose any content or layouts.

## Upload the Beaver Builder plugin

* From your WordPress Admin Panel, go to Plugins > Add New > Upload.
* Choose the plugin on your local system and activate it after it has uploaded.

## Activate your license

If you have a paid version of Beaver Builder, activate your license to enable remote updates of the plugin.

* From your WordPress Admin Panel, go to Settings > Beaver Builder.
* On the License tab add your license number, which you can find on the Beaver Builder My Account page.

## Configure Beaver Builder admin settings

It isn’t necessary to configure the admin settings on the other tabs at Settings > Beaver Builder before you start editing, but it’s a good idea to familiarize yourself with the settings should you need them at some point in the future.

Start building!
