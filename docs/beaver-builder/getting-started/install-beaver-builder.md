These instructions are for new premium installations, reinstallations, and upgrades to or downgrades from one premium version to another.

* If you're upgrading from the free (Lite) version to a premium version, [purchase a premium version](https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com/pricing/) first.
* If you're upgrading from one premium version to another, [see this upgrade information first](/general/account-billing/upgrade-your-premium-license.md).
* If you're downgrading or canceling your subscription, [see this downgrade information first](/general/account-billing/downgrade-to-a-lower-version-of-beaver-builder.md/#downgrade-to-another-premium-version).

## Download the Beaver Builder plugin

Download the Beaver Builder plugin zip from the [My Account](https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com/my-account/) page. Your license number also appears on that page.

:::note **Note**
If you're a Mac/Safari user and the download shows up as a folder instead of a zip file, you won't be able to install, because WordPress requires uploading a zip file. See [this article](beaver-builder/troubleshooting/common-issues/i-cant-upload-the-installer-zip-file-because-it-is-unzipped-when-i-download.md) for the fix.

## Install the Beaver Builder plugin

:::note **Note**
As of WordPress 5.5, you don't have to uninstall existing Beaver Builder plugins to install a new one.
:::

1. From your WordPress Admin Panel, go to **Plugins > Add New** and click the **Upload plugin** button at the top of the screen.
2. Click **Browse** and select the downloaded zip file on your local system or just drag the file on top of the **Browse** button.  
The installer file name is shown just to the right of the button.
3. Click **Install now**.  
If you have the Lite version of the plugin installed, it is automatically deactivated when you install a premium version. You can delete the Lite plugin without losing your layouts.
If you already have a premium version of the Beaver Builder plugin installed, another screen will ask you to verify that the zip file you uploaded is the version you want to install. Click **Replace current with uploaded**. The plugin will be automatically activated.
4. If you're doing a fresh installation of any premium version, click **Activate** to activate the plugin.  

## Activate your license

Activate your license for new installations or check to make sure your license is still activated for upgrades and downgrades:

1. If you aren't already on the Beaver Builder settings page, then from your WordPress Admin Panel, go to **Settings > Beaver Builder**, then click the **License** tab.
2. For new installations, add your license number, which you can find on the [My Account](https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com/my-account/) page.  
For upgrades and downgrades, check to make sure your license is still active. The license number should remain the same.

If your premium version includes the Beaver Builder Theme, see [these instructions](/bb-theme/getting-started/install-the-bb-theme-and-child-theme.md) for how to install it.

## Configure Beaver Builder admin settings

It isn’t necessary to configure the admin settings on the other tabs at **Settings > Beaver Builder** before you start editing, but it’s a good idea to [familiarize yourself with the settings](/beaver-builder/management-migration/settings-overview.md) should you need them at some point in the future.

## Start building!

See the other articles in this Knowledge Base to start using Beaver Builder, especially the [editor basics](/beaver-builder/getting-started/bb-editor-basics.mdx).
