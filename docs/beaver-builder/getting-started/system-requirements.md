Requirements are different for building content layouts versus displaying
rendered layouts and theme areas (headers, footers, sidebars), as follows.

## Requirements for viewing rendered web pages built with Beaver Builder

**Applies to:** Published Beaver Builder content layouts and the Beaver
Builder theme areas

### Supported browsers

* The latest three versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. For Internet Explorer, current support is IE 11.

Example of "latest three versions": if the latest version is 66.0.3359.181,
then any release of versions 64-66 is supported.

:::note **Note**
Other versions of browsers generally work, but this list refers to
versions that Beaver Builder provides support for.

## Requirements for building content layouts

**Applies to:** Building layouts with Beaver Builder

### Supported browsers

* The latest major version of Chrome, FireFox, Safari and Edge

"Major version" refers to the first number of the version and all point
versions, for example, 9.0, 9.1, 9.2.

### Supported operating systems/devices

Standard operating systems are supported.

Editing Beaver Builder layouts on tablets has been improved. Note the
functionality is still subject to limitations inherent on smaller screens. See
the forum for tips and discussion about this feature.

### WordPress

:::note **Note**
For performance and security reasons, we recommend using the latest
version of WordPress and the highest version of PHP available on your host.
For instructions on updating your WordPress installation, [see this WordPress codex article](https://wordpress.org/support/article/updating-wordpress/).
:::

  * **Beaver Builder Plugin:  **WordPress 4.6 and above  
**Note:** Versions of WordPress since 4.9.6 require Beaver Builder Version
2.1.1.3 or higher.
  * **Beaver Builder Theme:** WordPress 4.1 and above
  * **Beaver Themer:** WordPress 4.6 and above

### PHP

We follow WordPress minimum requirements for PHP version. See the [wordpress.org requirements page](https://wordpress.org/support/article/requirements/) for current recommendations.

  * **All Beaver Builder products:**  
    * PHP 5.6.20 and above
    * PHP 7.4 is currently recommended by WordPress 
    * PHP 8 is supported for all Beaver Builder products with some warnings, which are fixed in Beaver Builder 2.5, Beaver Builder Theme 1.7.9, and Beaver Themer 1.4.

## jQuery

Beaver Builder enqueues the version of jQuery that is bundled with WordPress
core and only supports that version. It is quite possible that other versions
of jQuery will work, but use them at your own risk.
