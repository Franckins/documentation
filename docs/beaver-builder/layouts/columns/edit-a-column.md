You can modify column style and layouts in the following ways.

## Style tab

### Column dimensions

* Change the column widths when you have two or more columns across.  
Widths must add up to 100% on large devices. If you have [custom widths set or medium for small devices](/beaver-builder/layouts/columns/prevent-column-stacking-with-custom-widths.md), those widths can total less than 100%.  

:::tip **Tip**
When you have more than two columns across, it's easier to use the drag handle on the column instead of column settings to change the widths.

* Set a minimum column height.  
If you set a minimum column height for one column in a column group, it will propagate to all columns in the group.
* Equalize the column heights of all columns in the group, then choose whether the column content should be vertically aligned to the top, center, or bottom of the columns.   
The following screenshot shows two columns set to equal height and vertically centered.

### Text colors

You can set default text colors for the column. These colors override row colors for that column and apply to modules unless the modules have their own colors set. The options are text color, link color, text hover color, and heading color.

### Background effects

You can add a background color, color gradient, or image to the column. If you add an image, you can also add a color overlay. See this[ tip for determining column scope](/beaver-builder/layouts/columns/tips-for-working-with-columns.md#tip-3-figure-out-column-structure-for-existing-columns) to see where the background effect will apply.

:::note **Note**
You can't add dynamic backgrounds to columns, such as videos,
slideshows, or parallax.
:::

### Border

Columns have the [standard Border section](/beaver-builder/styles/effects/borders.md) that lets you add border lines, rounded corners, and shadows.

:::tip **Tip**
Set individual top, bottom, left, or right border to create horizontal or vertical column separators. Adjust column margins and padding on the **Advanced tab** to fine-tune the border placement.

## Advanced tab

There are all the usual [**Advanced** tab settings](/beaver-builder/layouts/advanced-tab-rows-columns-modules.md) for margins and padding, visibility, animations, and advanced HTML settings.


##  Open column settings for editing

**To open column settings in an empty column:**

When a column is empty, access **Column Settings** by hovering over the empty
column and clicking the  **Edit column** icon, as shown in the following
screenshot.

See [this article](/beaver-builder/layouts/columns/insert-columns.md) for how to insert a column.

**To open column settings for editing in a column with a module:**

1. Mouse over a module in the column to reveal the toolbar and click **Edit column**, as shown in the following screenshot.

  If you see a hamburger icon in the module toolbar, click that and mouse over **Edit column**.

2. Mouse over and then click **Column settings**.   
    The area that will be affected by the column settings will have a blue overlay when you mouse over it.  
    ![Parent column menu](/img/edit-column-parent-menu.png)
  If you mouse over a nested column and you want to edit its parent column, click **Parent settings.**
