There are several ways to insert columns.

:::note **Note**
There is a limit of 12 main columns in a layer and 4 nested columns
in a layer. If you're unable to insert new columns, check to see if you've reached the column limit. See the [column tips article](/beaver-builder/layouts/columns/tips-for-working-with-columns.md) for troubleshooting information.

## Drag and drop empty columns into the layout

You can use this technique to add columns or nested columns anywhere. It works
particularly well to construct complex column layouts before you start adding
modules.

:::tip **Tip**
If you want to add a single nested column inside another column, you'll probably need to use this method. By default, when you drag a module into an existing column, it creates a module layer. See [this example](/beaver-builder/layouts/columns/column-layouts-overview.md#nested-columns) of when you might want to created a single nested column.

**To drag one or more empty columns into the layout:**

  * In the Content panel, click the **Rows** tab and drag the column configuration you want into the layout.

##  Drag a module into the layout

Dragging a module into the layout automatically creates a new row with a
column around it, or a new module layer, or a new column to the left or right
of an existing one. In the following screenshot, an Icon module is being
dragged in between two other columns. The blue shading shows where the new
column will be inserted.

You can also [move](/beaver-builder/layouts/columns/move-a-column.md) and [duplicate](/beaver-builder/layouts/columns/duplicate-a-column.md) columns.
