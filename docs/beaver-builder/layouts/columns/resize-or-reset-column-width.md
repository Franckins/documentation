You can change column widths relative to the widths of other columns within the same column group. You can reset the columns in a column group to equal widthss. Finally, you can [add width percentages to apply specifically to medium and small devices](/beaver-builder/layouts/columns/prevent-column-stacking-with-custom-widths.md).

## Resize column width

There are two methods to resize column width. With both methods, resizing one column width resizes the other column widths in the same column group to maintain a total of 100%. The new setting applies to all device sizes unless you [change the width separately for medium and small devices](/beaver-builder/layouts/columns/prevent-column-stacking-with-custom-widths.md).

For example, by default two columns in a column group are sized at 50% width each. If you resize one column width to 60%, the other column automatically resizes to 40%.

### Method 1: Drag the column handle

This method is quick and easy.

* In your layout, mouse over a module and drag a column handle, shown here:

:::tip **Tip**
If have two modules in a single column, you can drag the handles on either module.

### Method 2: Use Column Settings

This method may not work well for changing the widths of more than two columns because every time you change one width, the others resize automatically to total 100%. 

1. [Open a column for editing](/beaver-builder/layouts/columns/edit-a-column.md).
2. On the **Style** tab, change the percentage in **Column width**.

## Reset column widths

With this procedure you can reset column widths to evenly divided widths for
the entire column group.

**To reset the column widths for the entire column group:**

* Mouse over a module to display its toolbar, then click **Edit Column > Reset column widths**.  
If the options display a hamburger icon, click that, then mouse over **Edit column**  to reveal the  settings.

:::note **Note**
If you have custom widths set for medium and small devices on the **Advanced** tab, you must change those manually.
