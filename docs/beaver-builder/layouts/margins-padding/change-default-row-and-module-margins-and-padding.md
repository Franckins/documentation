Beaver Builder has the following default margins and padding that set the
initial values when you open an individual row or column for editing. These
settings are the same on all sides (top, bottom, left, right) and on all
devices.

## Beaver Builder default margins and padding

Type  |  Built-in default  
---|---  
Row margins  |  0px  
Row padding  |  20px  
Column margins  |  0px  
Column padding  |  0px  
Module margins  |  20px  
Module padding  |  n/a  

Individual content modules have no padding.

If you find yourself making the same change to row or module margin settings
or row padding, it might be more efficient to change the setting at the global
level, Keep the following points in mind:

  * You can change default margins and padding for rows, and you can change the default margins for modules.  
You can't change the defaults for columns, and modules have no padding.

  * The default value applies to all sides. In other words, you can't set different default values for top, bottom, left and right.
  * You can set the defaults differently for each device size. If you set a value for desktop only, the tablet setting will inherit this value. The mobile value is controlled by autospacing. If autospacing is disabled, the mobile value is inherited from the desktop value. See [the article on troubleshooting margins and padding](/beaver-builder/layouts/margins-padding/troubleshooting-margins-and-padding.md) for more details about how mobile values are determined.

## To change default margins and padding site-wide

  1. Open one of your pages in Beaver Builder.
  2. In the upper right corner, click  **Tools > Global Settings**.
  3. To change the global values for rows, go to the **Rows** section and change the  **Margins**  and  **Padding**  values.
  4. To change the global values for modules, go to the **Modules** section and change the  **Margins**  value in the  **Modules**  section.
  5. You can toggle through the device views to check the settings per device. Click the desktop icon in each row to change to tablet and mobile view, as shown in the following screenshot.   
It's good to check, because a margin setting you apply to desktop will
automatically apply to all three device sizes, but a padding setting you apply
to desktop will apply only to large devices.
