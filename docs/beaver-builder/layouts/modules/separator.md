The Separator module inserts a horizontal line to separate content. It can be
styled for color, size, and spacing.

This module has the following settings on the **General** tab:

* Color
* Height
* Width  
You can choose a **%**, **px**, or **vw** unit of measurement. See [the article on relative units of measurement](/beaver-builder/advanced-builder-techniques/css-length-height-units.md).
* Alignment (left, center, right)
* Style (solid, dashed, dotted, double)

By default, the Separator line is 1 px high, 100% wide, and a light gray color. 

There are all the usual [**Advanced** tab settings](/beaver-builder/layouts/advanced-tab-for-rows-columns-modules.md) for margins, visibility, animations, and advanced HTML settings.
