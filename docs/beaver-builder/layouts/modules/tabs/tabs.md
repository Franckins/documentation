Use the Tabs module to insert tabbed text content into your layouts. This is a
great tool for inserting large amounts of text into a small space.

The Tabs module consists of any number of items, each with a label-text pair.
The label becomes the tab name, and for text, you can enter anything that a
Text Editor window accepts, including images.

There are two options:

  * Layout
  * Border color of the tab box.

You can choose a horizontal layout, as this screenshot shows:

Or you can choose a vertical layout, as in this screenshot:

![](/img/tabs-module-2.jpg)

As the screen width shrinks, the tabs turn into an accordion layout:

## Advanced tab

There are all the usual [**Advanced** tab settings](/beaver-builder/layouts/advanced-tab-rows-columns-modules.md) for margins, visibility, animations, and advanced HTML settings.
