Use the Text Editor module to add a block of text. The Text Editor module uses
an instance of the standard WordPress editor. The difference is that you have
more control in positioning the text on the page.

You can add headings images, and make simple changes to text formatting, just
as you do in the standard WordPress editor.

:::tip **Tip**
If you want more control over the spacing of headings, images, and
text, use separate Heading and Photo modules.

## Style tab
You can style text within the text editor itself, but on the Style tab that are a number of settings that apply to the entire body of text, such as text color, font settings, and horizontal alignment, making it easy to set and change options that apply to the entire module.

## Advanced tab

There are all the usual [**Advanced** tab settings](/beaver-builder/layouts/advanced-tab-for-rows-columns-modules.md) for margins, visibility, animations, and advanced HTML settings.
