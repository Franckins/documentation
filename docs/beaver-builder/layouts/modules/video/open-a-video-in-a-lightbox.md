As an alternative to embedding a video directly in your page, you can have a
visitor click to play a video in a lightbox.

Here are the requirements for using the video lightbox:

  * This feature works from the **Button** module, not from buttons in other modules such as a Callout.
  * You must use a URL to a location that can play the video, such as Youtube or Vimeo. It will not work with a video uploaded to your media library.

See the [Button module overview](/beaver-builder/layouts/modules/button/button.md) for instructions on how to use this feature.
