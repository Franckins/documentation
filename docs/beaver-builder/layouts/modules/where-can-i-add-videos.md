You can add a video in any of the following locations.

* Any row background.  
* A [Video module](/beaver-builder/layouts/modules/video/video.md), either to embed the video in the page or play it in a lightbox.
* A Button module, to display a button that the user clicks to  [open the video in a lightbox](/beaver-builder/layouts/modules/video/open-a-video-in-a-lightbox.md).
* A slide in a Content Slider module, as either background or content.
* Code for a video lightbox in an HTML module, though it's recommended you use a Video module so you can enter structrured information about the video to improve search.
