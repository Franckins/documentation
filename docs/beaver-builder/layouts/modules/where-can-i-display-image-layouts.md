There are a number of modules that you can use to display images. They are
broken out here by whether or not you want to group the images with text.

## Single images

###  [Photo module](/beaver-builder/layouts/modules/photo/photo.md)  
Display single images, with a number of options.

## Gallery of images

 ### [Gallery module](/beaver-builder/layouts/modules/gallery/gallery.md)
Choose the **Collage** layout to display images in a mosaic. Choose
**Thumbnails** to display the images in a grid. There are options for
displaying captions.

 ### [Slideshow module](/beaver-builder/layouts/modules/slideshow.md)
If you turn off the playback on this module, you can display one image at a
time with arrows to cycle through the rest of the gallery.

## Animated images

You can apply [basic animations](/beaver-builder/styles/effects/animations.md) to any module, but
some modules are designed to rotate the display of images

 ### [Slideshow module](/beaver-builder/layouts/modules/slideshow.md)

The Slideshow module cycles through a gallery one image at a time, at a speed
you choose.

 ### [Content slider module](/beaver-builder/layouts/modules/content-slider.md)
Content sliders are typically used on landing pages with long narrow images,
which are displayed in the background so there may be some cropping to fit the
row. With the content slider module, you can add a heading, text, and button
overlays on the image.

 ### [Posts slider module](/beaver-builder/layouts/modules/posts/posts-slider.md)  
Display your blog posts in a slider. If you have set featured images, the
images will display, and you have options on where to place the post summary
in relation to the image.

 ### [Posts carousel module](/beaver-builder/layouts/modules/posts/posts-carousel.md)
Display your blog posts as a carousel, where you see several posts at a time
and advance forward and backward to display more. If you have set featured
images on your blog posts, you have options on where to place the post summary
in relation to the image.

## Images grouped with blocks of text

 ### [Callout module](/beaver-builder/layouts/modules/callout-and-call-to-action.md) 
The Callout module is great for displaying the popular rows of features,
popular on landing pages, and you can use this module for many other purposes.
A big advantage of this module is that the image-text group stays together as
a unit on smaller devices.

## Background images

You can add images to the backgrounds of rows and columns. A good image width for a
full-width row is usually considered to be 1950px. Rows also allow backgrounds with image animations, such as slideshows and [a Ken Burns effect](/beaver-builder/layouts/rows/row-effects/create-a-ken-burns-effect-in-a-row-background.md).
