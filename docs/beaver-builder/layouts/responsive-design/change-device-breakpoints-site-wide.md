By default the browser-width breakpoints for the Beaver Builder plugin are as
follows:

  * Medium device breakpoint: `992px`.  
At a screen width of `992px`, layout behavior changes to that for medium-sized devices.
  * Small device breakpoint: `768px`.  
At a screen width of `768px`, layout behavior changes to that for small-sized devices.

For more information, see [the article about breakpoints](/beaver-builder/layouts/responsive-design/breakpoints-for-device-sizes.md).

You can customize these default breakpoints by changing the Beaver Builder global settings.

:::note **Notes**
* These global settings affect only breakpoint behavior in the Beaver Builder plugin, including Beaver Themer layouts. To change breakpoint settings that affect the Beaver Builder Theme, see [the article about the Customizer **General** tab](/bb-theme/customizer-settings/general.md#theme-medium-breakpoint-and-mobile-breakpoint).
* If you change these breakpoints globally, don't forget to check if the change affects any of your custom CSS rules.
