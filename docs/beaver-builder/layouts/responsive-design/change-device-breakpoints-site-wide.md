By default the browser-width breakpoints for the Beaver Builder plugin are as
follows:

  * Medium device breakpoint: `992px` and below  
At `992px`, layout behavior changes to that for medium-sized devices.

  * Small device breakpoint: `768px` and below  
At `768px`, layout behavior changes to that for small-sized devices.

The change to medium or small device behavior affects two areas:

  * Any restrictions you put on visibility in the **Breakpoint** field of the **Advanced** tab
  * Column stacking.

For details, see [the article about breakpoints](/beaver-builder/layouts/responsive-design/breakpoints-for-device-sizes.md).

You can customize these default breakpoints by changing the Beaver Builder global settings.

:::note **Notes**
* These global settings affect only breakpoint behavior in the Beaver Builder plugin, including Beaver Themer layouts. To change breakpoint settings that affect the Beaver Builder Theme, see [the article about the Customizer **General** tab](/bb-theme/customizer-settings/general.md).

* If you change these breakpoints globally, don't forget to check if the change affects any of your custom CSS rules.
