Responsive Editing Mode lets you preview pages as they appear on medium and
small devices and edit them directly in that device size view.

The Beaver Builder editor's default layout is for large screens, and
Responsive Editing Mode makes it much easier to adjust the settings for medium
and small devices. If you prefer, you can enter Responsive Editing Mode
immediately and build a mobile layout, then adjust for larger screens. Either
way, chances are that as you work you will want to tweak your original design
to optimize it for every device size.

Enter Responsive Editing Mode in any of the following ways:

  * Click one of the [small responsive icons next to specific settings](/beaver-builder/layouts/responsive-design/responsive-settings-icon.md) for a row, column, or module.  
  Your page view will stay in responsive editing mode even if you close the
**Settings** window. Use the **Exit** button to close responsive editing.
  * On the **Tools** menu, click **Responsive editing**.
  * Type the keyboard shortcut <kbd>R</kbd>  
  This keyboard shortcut toggles responsive editing mode to open in medium
device view, change from medium to small device view, and close the responsive
editing window.  
  Note that keyboard shortcuts are always lowercase letters.

Here's an example in which we start with a large layout and tweak the medium
and small versions.

## Large screen

The following screenshot shows a single row with a background image, with two
layers of two columns each. In this example, all of the column margins are set
to 80px.

A best practice for large screens is to zoom in and out on your browser to
test that the layout will look good to users at the magnification they prefer.
Holding down the Ctrl key (or the âŒ˜ key on Mac), click + or - on the keyboard
to magnify and shrink the text, images, and videos respectively. Make any
corrections to your large display so it looks good at a range of zooms.

## Medium screen

Enter Responsive Editing mode, and you'll immediately see the medium-screen
display for a prototypical tablet device in portrait orientation, as shown in
the following screenshot.

Immediately you can see that the column are now too small for the content, and
the headings are bleeding across the column border because the font is too
big. One solution is to adjust the Icon modules so the icons and text are
smaller, but the columns are just too narrow, so our solution is to change the
column margins from 80px to 40px on medium devices.

To do this, open each of the four column settings, and click the **Advanced**
tab. The **Margins** field automatically displays the setting for medium
devices, as you can see by the tablet icon displayed next to the **Margins**
label. Because we haven't set a value yet for medium size, the field values
are initially empty. Set one margin value to **40** and click the **Link
values** icon to synch all four values, as shown in the following screenshot.
When this toggle is active, the icon displays in blue.

That initial change doesn't look so good, but once you set all four columns,
the result is much better, as the following screenshot shows.

You can further tweak text size and icon size for medium size devices. You can
also set a different row background image for medium size devices.

Good idea to save your layout at this point. When you publish, the screen
returns to the default large screen, and the large screen layout may not look
right. Clear your caches, especially your browser cache, and that should fix
the display.

## Small screen

Repeat this process for mobile by entering Responsive Editing Mode and then
clicking the phone icon. The following screenshot shows mobile view before any
mobile-specific changes made to settings

Make sure the columns have stacked the way you expected them to. You can
[reverse the stacking order](/beaver-builder/layouts/columns/reverse-column-stacking-order.md), or you can [prevent stacking](/beaver-builder/layouts/columns/prevent-column-stacking-with-custom-widths.md) by adding column width
values in the small-device column settings. For example, to preserve the two-
column two-layer layout from the large screen used in this example, set each
of the four column widths to 50%.

You can adjust the column margins specifically for mobile. In the
following screenshot, we set the column's top margin to 20px and clicked the
**Linked values** icon toggle to set the same value for all four sides for
small devices.

:::tip **Tip**
By default, Beaver Builder enables auto spacing on small devices,
which automatically adjusts margins and padding to reduce the need to make a
lot of manual adjustments. If your results for small devices are not what you
expect, see [this article](/beaver-builder/layouts/margins-padding/troubleshooting-margins-and-padding.md) on troubleshooting margins and padding.

## Do other checks

Don't rely only on the view Responsive Editing Mode. Mobile devices in
particular have many different screen sizes, and specific differences between
devices can still pop up. Expand your device checks by [using various
simulators and emulators](/beaver-builder/troubleshooting/miscellaneous/device-previews-beaver-builder-customizer-and-beyond.md).
