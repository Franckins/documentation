In the Settings panel for any row, column, or module, you can set a different value for each device size anywhere you see this desktop icon:

When you click the icon, the icon changes from desktop to tablet and the layout goes into [Responsive Editing Mode](/beaver-builder/layouts/responsive-design/responsive-editing-with-beaver-builder.md) for medium-sized devices.

Click the icon again and it changes to a mobile icon, with the mobile view in Responsive Editing Mode:

By default, setting a single value applies to every device size. With Beaver's Builder's [automatic responsive adjustments](/beaver-builder/layouts/responsive-design/responsive-behavior-in-beaver-builder.md), you often don't have to tweak the settings any further. But you can fine-tune the settings at each device size if you want.

The responsive settings occur most often for the following settings:

* Margin and padding settings on the [**Advanced** tab](/beaver-builder/layouts/advanced-tab-rows-columns-modules.md) and **Style** tab of rows, columns, and modules
* [**Typography** section](/beaver-builder/styles/typography/typography.md) settings in modules
* [**Border** section](/beaver-builder/styles/effects/borders.md) settings in rows, columns, and modules
* **Alignment** settings in modules.
* A few specific options that relate to height, width, or spacing within or between modules.
