[Layout templates](/general/glossary.md/#layout-template-bb) are Beaver Builder layouts containing any combinations of rows, columns, and modules. They can be
appended to or replace existing layouts in both standard layouts and Beaver
Themer layouts. After a layout template is added to a page, any aspect of its
layout or content can be modified.

:::tip **Tip**
If you're not sure what the content area of a page is, see [this article](/beaver-builder/getting-started/what-can-i-do-with-beaver-builder.md/#plugin-vs-theme-vs-beaver-themer).
:::

Layout templates are accessed from the **Templates** tab in the Content panel
at the upper right of the screen.

There are three types of layout templates in Beaver Builder:

  * Built-in layout templates
  * Saved layout templates
  * Third-party layout templates

##  Built-in layout templates

Beaver Builder comes with a number of built-in layout templates, which can be
a shortcut to designing your pages. Use a layout template that's similar to
the design you want, make tweaks to the layout, and add your own content, and
you've got a great looking page in no time. Or just try out various layout
templates for inspiration or to learn how the layout was constructed.

### Landing page templates

[Landing page templates](https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com/landing-page-templates/) are layouts suitable for use as a landing page or home page. The following screenshot shows some examples.

### Content page templates

[Content page templates](https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com/content-page-
templates/) focus on specific types of pages, such as portfolios, contact,
FAQs, or a signup form. The following screenshot shows a few examples.

##  Saved layout templates

You can save the Beaver Builder layout of any page or post as a template. This
is useful in several ways:

* You want your site to conform to a layout across more than one page.
* You want to use the same layout or content on another site. In this case, you can export the saved template and import it in the other site.
* You want to share your layout with another person, or they want to share with you. Exported layouts can be used by anyone else with a premium version of Beaver Builder.

:::note **Note**
Saved layout templates are NOT global. That means if you edit a
saved template, it will not affect any pages that you've already added the
template to. Nor will a change to any particular page with a template affect
the saved template or other instances of it.

###  Import saved layout templates

You can import saved layout templates. These can be layout templates that
you've exported from another site or that someone else has exported and shared
with you. See [the article bout importing and
exporting layout templates](/beaver-builder/layouts/templates/export-and-import-saved-templates-rows-columns-modules.md).

### Alternatives to saved layout templates

Besides layout templates, there are a couple other options for reusing layout:

  * **Duplicate the layout to a new page**  
You can [duplicate the Beaver Builder layout to a new page](/beaver-builder/getting-started/bb-editor-basics/duplicate-your-beaver-builder-layout-to-another-page.md) on your site
without the need to save it as a layout template.

  * **Use prebuilt rows**  
You can choose from dozens of [prebuilt rows](/beaver-builder/layouts/rows/add-prebuilt-rows-to-your-content.md) to
add to your content.

  * **Save individual rows, columns, and modules**  
You can [save](/beaver-builder/layouts/templates/save-a-row-column-or-module-for-reuse.md) and [export](/beaver-builder/layouts/templates/export-and-import-saved-templates-rows-columns-modules.md) individual rows, columns,
or modules. If you save them as global objects, you can make a change in one
place and the change is reflected everywhere else in the same site.

  * **Copy and paste modules**  
You can [copy and paste individual modules and module styles](/beaver-builder/getting-started/bb-editor-basics/copy-and-paste-modules-or-module-styles.md), both within your same site and across sites.

## Third-party layout templates

Third-party layout templates usually appear as a separate group on the
**Templates** tab, which give you a better idea where they came from. They are
used in the same way as any other template type.
