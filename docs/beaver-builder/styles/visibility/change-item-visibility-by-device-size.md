By default, every row, column, and module is visible on every device size, but you can hide individual elements at certain device sizes.

## Device Toggle Icons

Using the device toggle icons, you can quickly select which devices display or hide a row, column, or module. Simply click the device icon to toggle whether the element is displayed (blue) or hidden (gray) for those devices.

You can choose one of the following device toggle icons:

* **Extra Large Device**  
  The element will be visible or hidden for desktop computers or TVs with a browser.

* **Large Device**  
  The element will be visible or hidden for small desktop computers, laptops, and landscape tablets.

* **Medium Device**  
  The element will be visible or hidden for devices like small tablets.

* **Small Device**  
  The element will be visible or hidden for devices like portrait tablets, and smartphones.

## Multi-selection

The device toggle supports multi-selection and allows you to select more than one device. As a result, you are not limited to preset combinations, such as Large & Medium or Medium & Small, and can create any combination you wish.

It is possible, for example, to display a row on Extra Large, Large, and Small devices and hide the row on Medium devices. In addition, a Heading module can be hidden on Extra Large and Small devices, but displayed on Large and Medium devices.
