The [Post Object field](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/post-object/) of Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) is supported in Beaver Themer through a field connection shortcode. This field enables the creation of a list of posts.

## Getting Started

Begin by creating a Post Object field in ACF, and then customize the field to your preferences using the available options provided, such as Filter by Post Type, Taxonomy, allowing Multiple, and assigning a Location Rule.

:::caution
The Post Object field connection **is not** compatible with [ACF Option Pages](../options-page.md).
:::

After configuring the field, navigate to the WordPress Edit Screen for the page, post or custom post type that you specified in the Location Rule option, and add your pages, posts, or custom post type items to the field.

## Using the Post Object Field

To use the Post Object field and generate a list of posts in a page, post or custom post type, add an HTML module to your layout, and click the Plus **(+)** icon to open the Field Connection list panel. Next, select between Connect or Insert and configure the shortcode using the available options.

## Shortcode

Below is an example of the Post Object field connection shortcode.

```markup
[wpbb post:acf_relational type='post_object' name='FIELD_NAME' list_type='ul' post_title_link='yes']
```

You can enter your Post Object field name in the `name=''` attribute.

### Options	

* **List Type** - There are three options available: Regular, which uses the `<div>` tag, Ordered List, which uses the `<ol>` tag, and Unordered List, which uses the `<ul>` tag.

* **Add Post Title Link** - Yes or No.

### Markup Output

Depending on the [List Type](#options) option you choose, the HTML markup generated by the field connection will differ. Nevertheless, in all three List Type options, a distinct classname for the post ID is given to every list or div item, allowing you to apply custom CSS and style your post object list to your liking.

The following three code examples showcase the distinct HTML markup for each List Type option, along with the post ID classname, which is `post-123` in all of the examples.


```html title='Unordered List (<ul>)'
<ul>
	<li class="post-123">
		<a href="https://my-website.com/hello-world" title="Hello World">Hello World</a>
	</li>
</ul>
```

```html title='Ordered List (<ol>)'
<ol>
	<li class="post-123">
		<a href="https://my-website.com/hello-world" title="Hello World">Hello World</a>
		</li>
</ol>
```

```html title='Regular (<div>)'
<div>
	<div class="post-123">
		<a href="https://my-website.com/hello-world" title="Hello World">Hello World</a>
	</div>
</div>
```

## Ordering your Post Object Items

To sort your Post Object items, navigate to the location where your Post Object field was assigned through the Location Rule. You can then use drag-and-drop to rearrange the items in any order you prefer by dragging your pages, posts, or custom post type items. The field connection shortcode will respect the changes made when publishing.
