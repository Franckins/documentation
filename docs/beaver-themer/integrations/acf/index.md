This article covers the Beaver Themer integration with Advanced Custom Fields.

## Introduction

The Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) plugin provides a way to add more data to your pages, posts, and custom post types in WordPress. With Beaver Themer, you can create field connections or field connection shortcodes to retrieve the contents of custom fields you have made with ACF ([free](https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-custom-fields/) or [premium](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/pro/)) plugin.

In addition, these field connections are available not only in Beaver Themer layouts, but also in regular Beaver Builder layouts, provided that Beaver Themer is installed.

## Availability

With the installation of Beaver Themer, field connections become available in both Beaver Builder and Beaver Themer layouts, providing you with numerous choices in terms of where and how you wish to showcase custom fields.
