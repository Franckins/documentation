The following warning appears when you launch Beaver Builder on a page or post that already has a Beaver Themer layout applied. 

> This post has a Themer layout assigned to it. Would you like Beaver Builder to override the entire layout or only the content for this post?

The warning provides three options:

* **Override Layout**  
  Allows you to edit the layout of the page or post using Beaver Builder. This will replace the Beaver Themer layout you assigned to the page or post.

* **Edit Content Only**  
  Allows you to change the Post Content module by launching Beaver Builder on the Beaver Themer layout. This is the content that you added to the WordPress editor.   

* **Cancel**
  Closes Beaver Builder and returns you to edit page or post screen in the WordPress admin dashboard.
