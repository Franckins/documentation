If you have a Singular Themer layout type that appears when you preview a post but does not work when you view the actual post. It's likely caused by the theme template being used on that page or post.

## Cause

There are usually a few page and post templates available in your theme. The template selection field appears on the WordPress editing page.

For Singular Beaver Themer layouts, some templates other than **Default** may cause the Themer layout not to display.

## Fix

You can fix the problem by changing the template of your page or post to the **Default** template from the WordPress Edit Screen.

### Standard Editor (Gutenberg)

Your post's template can be found in the **Template** section of the WordPress Edit Screen if you use the WordPress standard editor (Gutenberg).

### Classic Editor

Using Classic Editor, you can find which template is assigned to your post under **Post Attributes**.

If your Singular layout applies to a page, you can find out what template is assigned in the **Page Attributes** section.
