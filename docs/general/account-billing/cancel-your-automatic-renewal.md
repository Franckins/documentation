All annual licenses are set as a “subscription”, and all purchases made after May 1, 2017, will renew automatically. You will receive a notification prior to renewal. You can cancel auto-renewal at any time from the Beaver Builder account area. If you cancel auto-renewal, we cannot reinstate it later.

To cancel automatic renewal:

1. Go to your **My Account** page and scroll to the **My Subscriptions** section.
2. Click the **Cancel Renewal** button next to the subscription you would like to cancel.

If you don’t see the **Cancel Renewal** button, it means you’re not in the auto-renewal program and you will need to manually renew each year. If you don’t renew and no longer have a license, you will not be able to download products or receive product updates. Please see our [Terms and Conditions](https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com/terms-and-conditions/).

:::warning Important
If you pay using PayPal and **do not** want to cancel your Beaver Builder subscription, cancelling auto-renewal is the preferred method, rather than cancelling your PayPal Billing Agreement. Please see this article about [Why did my Beaver Builder subscription cancel?](/general/account-billing/subscription-cancel.md)
