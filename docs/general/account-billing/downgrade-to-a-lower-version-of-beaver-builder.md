This article has information about downgrading from one premium version to
another or downgrading from a premium version to the free Beaver Builder Lite
plugin. If you want to stop using Beaver Builder entirely, see the Related
Article below on how to uninstall.

:::important Notes:
  * If your premium version is more than 30 days beyond purchase we cannot issue a refund if you choose to downgrade. See our refund policy in [Terms and Conditions](https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com/terms-and-conditions/).
  * Unlicensed versions of the Beaver Builder plugin and theme will continue to work, but you will no longer be able to update them. For security and (eventually) compatibility reasons, it's a good idea to use plugins and themes that you can keep updated, so we recommend that you switch to another theme or plugin instead of continuing to use an unlicensed version.

## Downgrade to another premium version

You can downgrade from one premium version to another at any time with
continued eligibility for the annual renewal discount for your new rate. If
you downgrade within 30 days of a purchase or renewal, we'll refund the
difference in versions.

When you downgrade, you will lose the features from the higher version. See
[the pricing table on our website](https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com/pricing/)
for a summary of the features at each level.

No matter which premium version you use, you'll have access to the entire set
of Beaver Builder plugin rows, columns, and modules, both on the rendered
pages and in the Beaver Builder editor.

**To downgrade from one premium version to another:**

  1. File a Beaver Builder Support ticket to request a downgrade. Tell us which version you want to downgrade to, and give us identifying information for your subscription, such as your license number or the email address that you used to purchase the subscription. Note that we cannot refund the difference in versions after the first 30 days of a subscription of renewal.
  2. After you're notified of the downgrade, go to your [My Account](https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com/my-account/) page and download the new version of the plugin from the website.  
If you downgrade from Agency to Pro version, the version of the Beaver Builder
Theme remains licensed and you don't have to reinstall it. If you downgrade
from Pro to Standard, the Beaver Builder Theme will continue to work but you
won't be able to update it, so we encourage you to switch to another theme.

  3. On the WordPress admin panel, click **Plugins** to display your list of installed plugins.
  4. Deactivate and delete the Beaver Builder plugin.  
You won't lose data or layouts or custom CSS when you delete the plugin.

  5. On the **Installed plugins** page, click **Add new** and upload, install, and activate the new version of the plugin.
  6. Go to **Settings > Beaver Builder** and click the **License** tab. Check that your license is still active. If not, copy the license number on your [My Account](https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com/my-account/) page and enter it on the **License** tab.

## Downgrade from a premium version to the free Beaver Builder Lite plugin

If you downgrade from any premium version to the free Beaver Builder Lite
plugin, the only modules that will continue to function on the live site and
in the editor are the ones contained in the Lite version. What's left on the
Beaver Beaver Lite editing page is the framework of rows and columns that were
previously there and any modules that are still supported.

See the [Beaver Builder Lite plugin page](https://wordpress.org/plugins/beaver-builder-lite-version/) for a list of modules supported by the free version. If you open the page in the WordPress editor, you can see any text and image portions of the
modules that could be converted. Modules such as the Posts module will not be
converted to the WordPress editor.
