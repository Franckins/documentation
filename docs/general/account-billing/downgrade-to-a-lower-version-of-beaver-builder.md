This article has information about downgrading from one premium version to
another or downgrading from a premium version to the free Beaver Builder Lite
plugin. If you want to stop using Beaver Builder entirely, see [the article about  how to uninstall](/beaver-builder/troubleshooting/updates-license/uninstall-or-deactivate-the-beaver-builder-plugin/#uninstall-beaver-builder-plugin-and-settings.md).

:::important **Important**
  * If your premium version is more than 30 days beyond purchase we cannot issue a refund if you choose to downgrade. See our refund policy in [Terms and Conditions](https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com/terms-and-conditions/).
  * Unlicensed versions of the Beaver Builder plugin and theme will continue to work, but you will no longer be able to update them. For security and (eventually) compatibility reasons, it's a good idea to use plugins and themes that you can keep updated, so we recommend that you switch to another theme or plugin instead of continuing to use an unlicensed version.

## Downgrade to another premium version

You can downgrade from one premium version to another at any time with
continued eligibility for the annual renewal discount for your new rate. If
you downgrade within 30 days of a purchase or renewal, we'll refund the
difference in versions.

When you downgrade, you will lose the features from the higher version. See
[the pricing table on our website](https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com/pricing/)
for a summary of the features at each level.

No matter which premium version you use, you'll have access to the entire set
of Beaver Builder plugin rows, columns, and modules, both on the rendered
pages and in the Beaver Builder editor.

### Get and download the downgrade version

  1. File a Beaver Builder Support ticket to request a downgrade. Tell us which version you want to downgrade to, and give us identifying information for your subscription, such as your license number or the email address that you used to purchase the subscription. Note that we cannot refund the difference in versions after the first 30 days of a subscription of renewal.
  2. After you're notified of the downgrade, go to your [My Account](https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com/my-account/) page and download the new version of the plugin from the website.  

:::note **Note**
If you downgrade from Agency to Pro version, the version of the Beaver Builder
Theme remains licensed and you don't have to reinstall it. If you downgrade
from Pro to Standard, the Beaver Builder Theme will continue to work but you
won't be able to update it, so we encourage you to switch to another theme.

### Install the downgrade version on your site

### If you're using WordPress 5.5:

1. Go to the WordPress admin panel for your site and click **Plugins**.
2. Click the **Add new** button at the top of the page, then **Upload plugin**.
3. Click **Browse** and select the downloaded plugin zip file on your local system, then click **Install now**.
3. On the next screen, verify that the zip file you uploaded is the version you want to install, then click **Replace current with uploaded**.
4. Go to **Settings > Beaver Builder** and click the **License** tab. Check that your license is still active. If not, copy the license number on your [My Account](https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com/my-account/) page and enter it on the **License** tab.
5. If you plan to discontinue using the Beaver Builder Theme, install the theme you want to use and switch to it following standard WordPress practice.   
If you plan to continue using the Beaver Builder Theme, you don't need to do anything.


### If you're using a version of WordPress prior to 5.5:

1. Go to the WordPress admin panel for your site and click **Plugins**.

  Your layouts and page content wonâ€™t be lost. You'll get a warning that Beaver Themer won't work without the Beaver Builder plugin, but you can ignore that message.

4. Go to **Settings > Beaver Builder** and click the **License** tab. Check that your license is still active. If not, copy the license number on your [My Account](https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com/my-account/) page and enter it on the **License** tab.

If you plan to continue using the Beaver Builder Theme, you don't need to do anything.

## Downgrade from a premium version to the free Beaver Builder Lite plugin

If you downgrade from any premium version to the free Beaver Builder Lite
plugin, the only modules that will continue to function on the live site and
in the editor are [the ones contained in the Lite version](/general/pre-sales/difference-between-free-and-premium-versions.md). 

After you downgrade, what's left on the
Beaver Beaver Lite editing page is the framework of rows and columns that were
previously there and any modules that are still supported. If you open the page in the WordPress editor, you can see any text and image portions of the
modules that could be converted.
