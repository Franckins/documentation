Here's what to do if you're getting a warning that your license was
deactivated on the **Settings > Beaver Builder > License** page in your
WordPress installation.

  1. Follow the link to your [My Account](https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com/my-account/) page and log in if necessary.
  2. Navigate to the **Domain Manager** section, and click **Manage Domains**.  
  3. Find your domain and click the **Reactivate** button.  
  4. Return to your websiteâ€™s **Settings > Beaver Builder > License** page and enter your license key again.
