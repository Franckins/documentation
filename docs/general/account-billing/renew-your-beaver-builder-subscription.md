When you purchase any premium version of Beaver Builder, you’ll have access to our support and updates to your licensed products for a year.

If you purchased Beaver Builder after May 1st, 2017, your license will renew automatically unless you switched to manual renewal.

If you purchased Beaver Builder before May 1st, 2017, you will need to manually renew your license from your account page. You’ll be able to renew one month before your subscription expires.

If you purchased Beaver Builder before October 13, 2022, your subscription and renewal pricing will remain as long as you renew within the 2 weeks after expiration.

You’ll receive an email the day your subscription expires with access to a renewal link. We will also send out a reminder email one week from the day your subscription expires.

If for some reason you don’t receive these emails, send us an [email](mailto:hello@wpbeaverbuilder.com) and we’ll get you fixed right up!
