Affiliates are not eligible for commission income when they place orders themselves through their own links. Additionally, an affiliate's already-existing partner or other affiliate of the Company may not place orders using the affiliate's links. This violates the affiliate program terms. 

For more information, see our [affiliate program terms and conditions](https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com/affiliate-program-terms-conditions/).
