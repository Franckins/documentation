Yes! See our [custom module developer guide](/beaver-builder/developer/custom-modules.index.md) article in the Knowledge Base. The guide contains a example plugin with a custom module that you can download.

You can also create custom WordPress widgets and use them with Beaver
Builder's WordPress Widgets modules anywhere in your content layout and in the
Beaver Builder Theme's widget menu.
