Our annual subscription fees are there so we can continue to provide you with
updates and outstanding support. (See our [Terms and Conditions](https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com/terms-and-conditions/).)

Here's what happens if you choose not to renew and your license expires. You
can't download Beaver Builder products anymore, but you can continue to
install and use any versions of Beaver Builder that you've already downloaded.
So essentially Beaver Builder freezes at the version you have installed when
your license expires. You won't be able to contact Beaver Builder Support for
help.

We cannot guarantee how long older versions of Beaver Builder will work if you
update other parts of your site or platform. This is because updates to PHP
WordPress, or other plugins can affect the functionality of Beaver Builder
products, and we often issue updates to stay compatible. It's wise from a
security standpoint to keep all your site's software up to date.

For these reasons, if you decide not to renew your license, we advise you to
start thinking about moving your content to another solution. Unlike other
page builders that use shortcodes, if you deactivate the Beaver Builder
plugin, the text and images are automatically made available in the WordPress
editor.
