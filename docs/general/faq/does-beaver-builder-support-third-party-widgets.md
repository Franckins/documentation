Yes, though some third-party widgets may require a modification to get them to work in the front end so they're compatible with Beaver Builder layouts. Both third-party widgets and the default WordPress
widgets show up in Beaver Builder's WordPress Widgets modules and in Beaver
Builder Theme's widget menu. See [the article on WordPress Widgets modules](/beaver-builder/layouts/modules/widgets.md) for more information.
