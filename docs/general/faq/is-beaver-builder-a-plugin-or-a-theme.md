The Beaver Builder page builder is a plugin, but some of our premium packages include a framework Beaver Builder Theme, as described here.

Our standard premium package includes just the Beaver Builder page builder plugin. The page builder
is a visual layout tool to help you build layouts and add
content to WordPress pages. The Beaver Builder plugin works with almost any
theme, but see [the list of incompatible themes](/beaver-builder/troubleshooting/debugging/known-beaver-builder-incompatibilities#themes.md).

Our Pro and Agency packages include both the Beaver Builder plugin and the
Beaver Builder Theme. The Beaver Builder Theme has lean code, great
customization options, and of course it integrates perfectly with the Beaver
Builder plugin. Another advantage of using the Beaver Builder Theme is that you can go straight to our stellar Support team for any questions, whether it pertains to the plugin or the theme.
