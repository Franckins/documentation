Yes. If you purchased Beaver Builder any time after May 1st, 2017, your
license will automatically renew one year after the purchase date.

If you purchased before May 1st, 2017, you will not be automatically billed.
You'll get an annual reminder of the renewal period and [renewal discount](/general/faq/is-there-a-discount-on-annual-renewals.md) and must renew your license manually if you want to continue (and we'll
be delighted).
