Yes, of course, you can upgrade from the free version to a premium version and
keep your content intact.

:::tip Tip:
Wondering which devices support Beaver Builder? Check out the [system requirements](/beaver-builder/getting-started/system-requirements.md).
:::

  1. Purchase the premium version, go to your [My Account](https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com/my-account/) page, and download the Beaver Builder plugin zip file.  
Your license key is listed on the same page.
  2. On the WordPress **Plugins > Add New** page, click **Upload plugin**.
  3. Select the plugin zip file that you downloaded, install it, and activate it.  
The Lite version of the plugin is automatically deactivated when you install a premium version.
**Tip:** Be careful not to mix up the plugin and theme zip files when you
upload! If your premium version includes the Beaver Builder Theme, see [these instructions](/bb-theme/getting-started/install-the-bb-theme-and-child-theme.md) for how to install it.
  4. From the WordPress admin panel, go to **Plugins > All plugins**, then delete the Lite version of plugin.
  5. From the WordPress admin panel, go to **Settings > Beaver Builder **and enter your license key so you can receive plugin updates automatically.
