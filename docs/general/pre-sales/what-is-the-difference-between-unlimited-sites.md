# Difference between Unlimited Sites and Multi Site capable

## Multi Site Capable

Normally for any site you want to use WordPress on, you install it separately so it's a standalone installation. Multi Site capable refers to a specific WordPress setup that lets you install WordPress once and manage multiple sites under that one installation (also referred to as a network).  You can read more about Network/Multisite setups over in the [WordPress documentation](https://wordpress.org/support/article/create-a-network/).  Only our Pro and Agency packages are Multi Site Capable.

## Unlimited Sites

Unlimited Sites refers to the number of sites that you can add your license key to.  There is no limit on any of our packages and that includes for Multi Site setups.  You also can use your license key across servers and even hosts.
