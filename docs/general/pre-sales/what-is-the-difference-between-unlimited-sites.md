# Difference between Unlimited Sites and Multi Site capable

## Multi Site Capable

Normally, you install WordPress on each site you build so it's a standalone installation. *Multisite-capable* refers to a specific WordPress setup that lets you install WordPress once and manage multiple sites under that one installation. This is also referred to as a network.  You can read more about network/multisite setups in the [WordPress documentation](https://wordpress.org/support/article/create-a-network/).  

Only the Beaver Builder Pro and Agency packages are multisite-capable.

## Unlimited Sites

Unlimited Sites refers to the number of sites that you can add your license key to.  There is no limit on any of our packages and that includes for Multi Site setups.  You also can use your license key across servers and even hosts.
