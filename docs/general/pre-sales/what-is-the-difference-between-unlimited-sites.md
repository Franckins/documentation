Here's the difference between *multisite-capable* and *unlimited sites* in relation to Beaver Builder packages and your Beavver Builder license.

## Multi Site Capable

Normally, you install WordPress on each site you build so it's a standalone installation. *Multisite-capable* refers to a specific WordPress setup that lets you install WordPress once and manage multiple sites under that one installation. This is also referred to as a network.  You can read more about network/multisite setups in the [WordPress documentation](https://wordpress.org/support/article/create-a-network/).  

Only the Beaver Builder Pro and Agency packages are multisite-capable.

## Unlimited Sites

*Unlimited sites* refers to the number of sites that you can add your license key to.  There is no limit on any of our packages, including network sites with multisite setups.  

*Unlimited sites* also means that you can use your license key across servers and even hosts.  

See our [Terms and Conditions](https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com/terms-and-conditions/) for details about the conditions under which you can use your license key.
