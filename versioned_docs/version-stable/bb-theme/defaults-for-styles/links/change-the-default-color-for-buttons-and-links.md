When you create items such as links or buttons, a default color is assigned to them. The base default color comes from the [Beaver Builder Theme preset](/bb-theme/customizer-settings/presets.md), which can be set at **Customize > Presets**.

You can override the preset default and [set a custom default accent color](/bb-theme/customizer-settings/general.md/#accent-color) at **Customize > General > Accent Color**.
