You can set a custom global button style in Customizer that applies as the default button style in Beaver Builder layouts. You can override the default settings in any specific module that uses a button.

The custom global button settings are at **Customize > General > Buttons**. For **Button style**, change **None** to **Custom**, which opens the following button settings:

  * Button text and background color
  * Text style (font family, weight, size, line height)
  * Button border style

These settings are identical to the **Style** tab for the **Button** module in Beaver Builder.
