description: Shows how to duplicate a Beaver Builder page or post with the same layout and metadata.
---

You can duplicate any Beaver Builder layout to a new page with the same layout
and metadata. This works for standard Beaver Builder layouts, Themer layouts,
and saved items: layout templates, rows, columns, and modules.

:::danger **Warning:**
Do not use duplicator plugins to duplicate pages with Beaver Builder layouts.
:::

After you've duplicated the layout, a new page is automatically created and
opens for editing. The new page has the following initial title and slug,
which you can modify:

  * Title: *`Copy of <original page title>`*
  * Slug: *`<original-slug-title>-copy`*

This action copies the entire page and all metadata from the back end,
including Yoast SEO data.

:::tip **Tip**
Instead of cloning layouts with this method, you can [save your layout
as a template](/beaver-builder/layouts/templates/create-and-save-a-custom-layout-template.md) to use on other pages, [export to other sites](/beaver-builder/layouts/templates/export-and-import-saved-templates-rows-columns-modules.md), or [have available
for clients to use in themes you deliver to them](/beaver-builder/developer/how-to-tips/theme-author-templates.md). 
:::

:::note **Note**
The Beaver Builder layout must have been either published or saved
before you duplicate the layout. If you make editing changes to the layout
after you open the page and then duplicate it before saving the page, the
duplicated page will not show the changes, and the changes may be lost on the
source page as well.
