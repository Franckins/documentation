You can modify column style and layouts in the following ways.

## Style tab

  * Change the column widths when you have two or more columns across.  
Widths must add up to 100% on large devices, but medium and small device
column width settings can total less than 100%.  
:::tip **Tip**
When you have more than two columns across, it's easier to use the drag handle on the column instead of column settings.

  * Set a minimum column height. If you set a minimum column height for one column in a layer, it will propagate to all columns in the layer.
  * Equalize the column heights of all columns in the layer, then choose whether the content in the column content should be vertically aligned to the top, center, or bottom of the column.   
Parent columns must have at least two columns in the layer for the **Equalize
heights** field to be displayed, but you only need to set it in one column for
it to apply to all columns in the layer. Achild columns display the **Equalize
heights** field.  
The following screenshot shows two columns set to equal height and vertically
centered.

  * Set default text colors for the column. These colors override row colors for that column and apply to modules unless the modules have their own colors set. The options are text color, link color, text hover color, and heading color.

  * Add a background color or image.  
:::note **Note**
You can't add dynamic backgrounds to columns, such as videos,
slideshows, or parallax.
:::

  * Add a column border.  
:::tip **Tip**
You can set individual top, bottom, left, and right borders, which you can use to create horizontal or vertical column separators.

## Advanced tab

There are all the usual [**Advanced** tab settings](/beaver-builder/layouts/advanced-tab-rows-columns-modules.md) for margins and padding, visibility, animations, and advanced HTML settings.


##  Open column settings for editing

If a column has child columns, you can edit either the child or the entire
parent column.

**To open column settings in an empty column:**

When a column is empty, access **Column Settings** by hovering over the empty
column and clicking the  **Edit column** icon, as shown in the following
screenshot.

See [this article](/beaver-builder/layouts/columns/insert-columns.md) for how to insert a column.

**To open column settings for editing in a column with a module:**

1. Mouse over a module in the column to reveal the toolbar and click **Edit column**, as shown in the following screenshot.

  If you see a hamburger icon in the module toolbar, click that and mouse over **Edit column**.

2. Do either of the following:
  1. Mouse over **Column settings**.  
The area that will be affected by the column settings will have a blue
overlay.
