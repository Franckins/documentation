There are several ways to insert columns.

:::note **Note**
There is a limit of 12 main columns in a layer and 4 child columns
within a column layer.

## Drag and drop empty columns into the layout

You can use this technique to add columns or child columns anywhere. It works
particularly well to construct complex column layouts before you start adding
modules.

:::tip **Tip**
If you want to add a single child column as a layer insider another
column, you'll probably need to use this method. By default, when you drag a
module into an existing column, it creates a module layer. See the Related
Article on column layouts for more details.
:::

**To drag one or more empty columns into the layout:**

  * In the Content panel, click the **Rows** tab and drag the column configuration you want into the layout.

##  Drag a module into the layout

Dragging a module into the layout automatically creates a new row with a
column around it, or a new module layer, or a new column to the left or right
of an existing one. In the following screenshot, an Icon module is being
dragged in between two other columns. The blue shading shows where the new
column will be inserted.
