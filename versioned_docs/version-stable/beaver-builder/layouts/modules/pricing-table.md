The Pricing Table module lets you insert a pricing table with as many columns
as you like. You can configure options such as column color, title, price,
frequency for recurring costs, a feature list, and a button.

Here's an example of a simple pricing table:

You can add HTML markup to the title, price, and features.

For example, suppose you want to show a crossed-out price with a sale price
displayed in red, shown in the following screenshot:In the **Price** field for
that line, enter the following markup:

```html
<s>$99</s> <span style="color:red;";>$79</span>
```
