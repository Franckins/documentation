The Sidebar module gives you the ability to insert any of your WordPress
sidebars into your layouts.

The widgets in the sidebar can be configured by going to **Appearance > Widgets** in the WordPress admin panel.

:::note **Note**
The Beaver Builder Theme has only one sidebar, called the Primary
Sidebar. If you want to create a different sidebar or which widgets appear
there, you must use a plugin or write code.
