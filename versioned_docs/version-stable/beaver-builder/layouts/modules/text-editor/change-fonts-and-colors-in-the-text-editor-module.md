In most Beaver Builder modules, you can customize fonts and font colors on the
**Style** tab. The Text Editor module is different.

**To change font color and style in the Text Editor module:**

  1. Open a Text Editor module for editing.
  2. Expose the second row of the toolbar by clicking the rightmost icon.

  3. You can change font size and color by using the icons outlined in the screenshot.

:::note **Note**
There's no option to change the font family in the Text Editor
module, but there are plugins you can add for this purpose, such as the Use
Any Font plugin. Note that there's a performance cost to using too many fonts
on your site because each one takes time to load.
