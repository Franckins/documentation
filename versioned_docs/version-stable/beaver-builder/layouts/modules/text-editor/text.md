Use the Text Editor module to add a block of text. The Text Editor module uses
an instance of the standard WordPress editor. The difference is that you have
more control in positioning the text on the page.

You can add headings images, and make simple changes to text formatting, just
as you do in the standard WordPress editor.

:::tip **Tip**
If you want more control over the spacing of headings, images, and
text, use separate Heading and Photo modules.
