Well, just about anywhere, in your page content or in the Beaver Builder Theme
header or footer.

## Beaver Builder

  * The **Menu** module, which you can place anywhere in your content
  * The **Posts**, **Posts Carousel**, or **Posts Slider** modules  
You can display either pages or posts in menu order, and you can display
content summaries or just titles.

  * **Custom menu widget**  (**WordPress widgets**)  
Beaver Builder lets you display WordPress widgets anywhere in your content.
Choose the **Custom menu** widget.

## Beaver Builder Theme

  * If you're using the Beaver Builder Theme, there are various places in the [header](/bb-theme/customizer-settings/header.md) and [footer](/bb-theme/customizer-settings/footer.md) where you can display up to three menus.
