In the row settings, there are two choices for row height:

  * Default  
The row height adjusts to fit the content.

  * Full height  
The row height fills the height of the browser window.

What if you want the row to be a height that's somewhere in between the two?

To preserve a responsive layout, the best way to do it is to use **Default**
at the row height setting and then adjust the top and bottom padding on the
**Advanced** tab of the row settings until you get the height you want. If you
don't have any content in your row yet, you can start with an empty column.
