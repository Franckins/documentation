You can control which modules will display in the Content panel in Beaver
Builder. If there are some modules you never use, or some modules you don't
want your clients to use, you can disable select modules, or even disable all
modules.

To disable or re-enable modules:

1. In the WordPress admin panel, click **Settings > Beaver Builder**, then click the **Modules** tab.
2. Clear the checkboxes of any modules you want to disable.
3. Click Save module settings.
