The Add to Cart Button module is in the **WooCommerce modules** category, which appears only when you're editing a Singular-type layout in Beaver Themer and you've assigned a single product page as the location.

Besides the **Add to Cart** button, this module also displays the following controls when they apply (the same as default WooCommerce behavior).

  * Variation labels and options (if the product has them)
  * A **Quantity** selection list
  * The **Add to Cart** button

The following screenshot shows an option label and selection list for a **Mug color** variation, a **Quantity** selection list, and the **Add to Cart** button.

## Module settings

This module has a **Style** tab and an **Advanced** tab.

The **Style** settings for this module are button background and text color. Whether the button is the default or a custom background and text color, the color is applied as follows to the three button states:

  * **Disabled** (the state that applies if there are variations and an option hasn't been selected yet)  
  A lighter version of the background and text color.
  * **Enabled** (ready to be clicked)  
  The default or custom background and text color.
  * **Hover** (cursor moves over the button)  
  A darker version of the background and text color.

On the **Advanced** tab, you can customize margins, responsive layout, visibility, animation, and assign an ID or class name.

:::note **Note**
The **Advanced** settings apply to the entire module block. Using the screenshot above as an example if you set a **Slide left** animation, the variation (mug color), quantity, and **Add to Cart** button will all slide left as a block.
