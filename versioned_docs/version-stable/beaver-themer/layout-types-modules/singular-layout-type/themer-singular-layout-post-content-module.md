The Post Content module is in the **Post modules** category, which appears only when you're editing a Singular-type themer layout in Themer. It creates the content area in the Singular Themer layout, and it displays the content that authors type into the native WordPress text editor.

:::note **Note**
WordPress has only one content area. Although you can add more than one Post Content module to a Singular themer layout, the content from the native WordPress text editor will appear in every place you add it, so you'll have duplicated content.
:::

The only settings available for the Post Content module are those on the **Advanced** tab, which means you can customize margins, responsive layout, visibility, animation, and assign an ID or class name.
