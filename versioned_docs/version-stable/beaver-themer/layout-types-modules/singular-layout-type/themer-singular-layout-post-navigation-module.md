The Post Navigation module is in the **Post modules** category, which appears only when you're editing a Singular-type themer layout in Themer. It displays links to previous and next posts, in reverse chronological order.

On large and medium devices, the Previous post link is left-aligned, and the Next post link is right-aligned. On small devices, they're stacked.

You can limit the navigation to be within the same taxonomy as the current post, in the **Navigate in same taxonomy** field on the **Settings** tab.

The navigation icon and text can be customized, as shown in the following screenshot.

On the **Advanced** tab there are the usual settings for margins, responsive layouts, visibility, animation, and assigning an ID or class name.
