When you purchase any premium version of Beaver Builder, you’ll have access to
our support and updates to your licensed products for a year. At the end of
each year, you can renew your subscription at a 40% discount.

If you purchased Beaver Builder after May 1st, 2017, your license will renew
automatically at the discounted rate.

If you purchased Beaver Builder before May 1st, 2017, you will need to
manually renew your license from your account page. You'll be able to renew
one month before your subscription expires and the 40% discount will be
available for two weeks after your subscription expires.

You’ll receive an email the day your subscription expires with access to a 40%
coupon. We will also send out a reminder email one week from the day your
subscription expires.

If for some reason you don’t receive these emails, send us an [email](mailto:hello@wpbeaverbuilder.com) and we’ll get you fixed right up!
