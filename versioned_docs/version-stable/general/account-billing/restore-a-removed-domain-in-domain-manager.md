OK, so you removed a domain from one of your sites using [Domain Manager](https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com/domain-manager/) on your [My Account](https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com/my-account/) page, and now you want to reinstate it?

You can do it through your website.

**To restore a removed domain in Domain Manager:**

  1. Open the WordPress admin panel of the website whose domain license you want to reinstate.
  2. Go to **Settings > Beaver Builder > License**.  
The license still shows as Active, but do the following steps to
record it back into Domain Manager.
  3. Click **Enter license key** and enter your license key.
  4. Click **Save license key**.

Now if you check back in Domain Manager, the domain is once again listed.
