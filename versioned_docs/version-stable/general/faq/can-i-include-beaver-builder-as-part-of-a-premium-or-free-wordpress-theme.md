We don't support bundling or redistributing the premium versions of Beaver
Builder with a theme, but you're free to do this with [the free
version](https://wordpress.org/plugins/beaver-builder-lite-version/).

There are several helpful features for theme authors bundling the free version
of Beaver Builder with a theme. You can include an affiliate link via a
filter, so if anyone upgrades Beaver Builder after learning about it from your
theme, you'll get a 25% commission on the sale. We also have a feature that
enables theme authors to build and include pre-designed templates with their
theme.

For more information, see this [blog post about bundling the free version](https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com/integrating-a-page-builder-with-your-wordpress-themes/) of Beaver Builder or [this Knowledge Base article about our theme author templates feature](/beaver-builder/developer/how-to-tips/theme-author-templates.md).
