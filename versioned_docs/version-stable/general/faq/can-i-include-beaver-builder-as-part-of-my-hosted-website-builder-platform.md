Yes! The features included in our Agency subscription are geared towards those
that wish to create their own DIY hosted website publishing business (like
SquareSpace).

While using Beaver Builder as part of a website builder is supported, we do
not support bundling or redistributing Beaver Builder as part of a traditional
web hosting product. To differentiate, if a user has access to the WordPress
admin area, web server backend, or PHP code (i.e., FTP access, backups, SSH,
etc.), we consider this standard hosting. In short, a custom administration
and onboarding process would need to be in place.

You are free to auto-install or bundle [the free version of Beaver Builder](https://wordpress.org/plugins/beaver-builder-lite-version/) with a traditional hosting package, though.
