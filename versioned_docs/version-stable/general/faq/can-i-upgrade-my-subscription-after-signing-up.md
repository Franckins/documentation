Yes, you can [upgrade from the free version of Beaver Builder](/general/pre-sales/upgrade-from-free-to-premium-version-of-beaver-buidler.md) to any premium version or [from any premium subscription to a higher one](/general/account-billing/upgrade-your-premium-license.md). If you've already purchased a Premium subscription, your new premium subscription is prorated for the difference in cost.

You can also [downgrade from one premium version to another](/general/account-billing/downgrade-to-a-lower-version-of-beaver-builder.md/#downgrade-to-another-premium-version) or [from a premium version to the free version](/general/account-billing/downgrade-to-a-lower-version-of-beaver-builder.md/#downgrade-from-a-premium-version-to-the-free-beaver-builder-lite-plugin).
