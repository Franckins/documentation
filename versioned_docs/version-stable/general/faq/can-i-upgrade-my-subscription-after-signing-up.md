Yes, you can upgrade from the free version of Beaver Builder to any premium
version, or from any premium subscription to a higher one. If you've already
purchased a Premium subscription, your new subscription is prorated for the
difference in cost. See the article below on upgrading your premium
subscription for more information.

You can also downgrade from one premium version to another.
