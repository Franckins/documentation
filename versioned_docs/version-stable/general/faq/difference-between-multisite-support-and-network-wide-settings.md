Our Pro package is "multisite capable," meaning it supports WordPress
multisite installations. With the Pro package, youâ€™ll need to configure Beaver
Builder settings on each site.

Our Agency package has a network-wide settings panel. With the Agency package,
you can configure Beaver Builder on all of your sites in the network from one
place, then override those settings on a site-by-site basis.
