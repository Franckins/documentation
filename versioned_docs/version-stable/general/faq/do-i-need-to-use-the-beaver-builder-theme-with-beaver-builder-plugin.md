No! Absolutely not. The Beaver Builder plugin was designed to work with nearly
all themes. (See the [list of known theme incompatibilities](/beaver-builder/troubleshooting/debugging/known-beaver-builder-incompatibilities.md/#themes).)

We do think Beaver Builder Theme is a great choice, for the reasons below.

## Fully integrated with the Beaver Builder plugin

WordPress themes can be really bloated with code. The Beaver Builder Theme is
fully integrated with the Beaver Builder plugin to maximize functionality and
performance. For example, both theme and plugin settings are taken into
account before Google fonts are loaded onto a page. You also have options such
as whether to load the set of Font Awesome icons on every page, or only pages
on which an icon appears.

Also, using both the plugin and theme makes Beaver Builder a one-stop shop: if
you have a problem with either plugin or theme, you can contact our great
Support team.

## Fully responsive, built on Bootstrap

If you're familiar with frameworks like Bootstrap, you'll be right at home
with the Beaver Builder Theme. It has Bootstrap baked into its core. When
writing custom styles for Beaver Builder, keep in mind that it follows the
same “mobile first” approach as Bootstrap.

##  Font Awesome Support

We’ve also baked in support for Font Awesome. It's easy to use any number of
their amazing icons in your custom child theme.

## Customization options

If you're a developer, here's a link to the theme hooks available for the
theme. This list is automatically updated with each release.
