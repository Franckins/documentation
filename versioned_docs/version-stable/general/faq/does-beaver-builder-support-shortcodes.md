Yup! It definitely does. Shortcodes enable you to use your _other_ favorite
plugins along with Beaver Builder.

You can also create shortcodes for Beaver Builder modules and insert them into
other parts of your site.

See [the shortcodes article](/beaver-builder/advanced-builder-techniques/shortcodes/use-shortcodes-in-your-layouts.md) for more information.
