Among the various eCommerce solutions, the Beaver Builder plugin is most fully
integrated with WooCommerce. There's a large collection of article in our [Knowledge Base](https://docs.wpbeaverbuilder.com)
about the integration of all of our Beaver Builder products with WooCommerce.

Our Beaver Themer plugin also has integrations with two other e-commerce platforms: [BigCommerce](/beaver-themer/integrations/bigcommerce/beaver-themer-layouts-for-bigcommerce.md) and [Easy Digital Downloads](/beaver-themer/integrations/easy-digital-downloads/beaver-themer-and-the-edd-plugin.md), with some special modules for both archive and single product
pages.

For other eCommerce solutions, Beaver Builder supports both widgets and
shortcodes. If the eCommerce plugin provides either a widget or a shortcode to
render products or a cart, then you can build your storefront using Beaver
Builder.
