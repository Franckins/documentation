Yes! By default, Beaver Builder is only enabled for pages, but you can easily
enable it for posts and custom post types from the Beaver Builder settings by
going to **Settings > Beaver Builder > Post Types** from the WordPress admin
panel.

Note that Beaver Builder is used for layouts in [the content area](/beaver-themer/getting-started/primer-on-wordpress-content-and-theme-areas-themer.md) of a page or post. To create layouts in other parts of the page
such as headers, footers, and post meta, and to display custom fields in your
layouts, that's where [Beaver Themer](/beaver-themer/getting-started/what-can-i-do-with-beaver-themer.md) comes in.
