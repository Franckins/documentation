Each release comes with a change log that describes enhancements and bug
fixes. You can access the change logs for all of the Beaver Builder products
in several ways.

  * Use this link to go directly to [https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com/change-logs/](https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com/change-logs/) .
  * From the **Installed plugins** page in WordPress, click the **Change log** link underneath the Beaver Builder plugin
  * If you're logged into your Beaver Builder account at [wpbeaverbuilder.com](https://wpbeaverbuilder.com), mouse over **Account** in the menu and choose **Change logs**.
