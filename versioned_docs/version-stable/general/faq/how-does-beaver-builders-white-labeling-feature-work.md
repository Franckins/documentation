Our Agency package allows you to “white label” Beaver Builder and give your
clients a truly white-glove experience. White labeling allows you to replace
the words Beaver Builder and the Beaver Builder logo with
your own company's name or logo.

:::note **Note**
White labeling only applies to the back end of your website. There
are no advertisements or mentions of Beaver Builder on the front end of your
site.
