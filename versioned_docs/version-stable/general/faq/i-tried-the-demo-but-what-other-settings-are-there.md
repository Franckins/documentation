If you've tried out [the demo at the Beaver Builder
website](http://demo.wpbeaverbuilder.com/), you already know how much
flexibility you have in setting up layouts, the variety of content modules
available, and the ease in changing settings on individual modules.

In the demo, you can also play around with saving modules, rows, and content
templates for reuse. You can also explore the **Tools** panel, where you can
change certain settings globally or  add CSS or JavaScript code that applies
either to a particular page or site-wide.

What you can't see in the demo is the **Settings** panel for Beaver Builder,
which can be accessed from **Settings > Beaver Builder** in the WordPress
admin panel. Here's [an overview of the Settings panel](/beaver-builder/management-migration/settings-overview.md).
