Both!

Our standard package includes just the Beaver Builder plugin. The Beaver
Builder editor is a visual layout tool to help you build layouts and add
content to WordPress pages. The Beaver Builder editor works with almost any
theme, but see [the list of incompatible themes](/beaver-builder/troubleshooting/debugging/known-beaver-builder-incompatibilities#themes.md).

Our Pro and Agency packages include both the Beaver Builder plugin and the
Beaver Builder Theme. The Beaver Builder Theme has lean code, great
customization options, and of course it integrates perfectly with Page
Builder. And you can go straight to our stellar Support team for any
questions, whether it pertains to the plugin or the theme.
