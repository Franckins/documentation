Probably everyone has heard of Gutenberg. It's the project name for
[the WordPress editor](https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/) that shipped with WordPress 5. It's also known as the block editor.

The Beaver Builder plugin is compatible with the WordPress 5 block editor
in the same way that it's compatible with the "classic" WordPress text editor.
Depending on whether you set WordPress to prefer the block editor or use a plugin to maintain the
classic editor, you can move text and images between Beaver Builder and the WordPress editor on a limited scale.

For more details see [the detailed article about how Beaver Builder works with Gutenberg](/beaver-builder/management-migration/convert-content-between-wordpress-5-and-beaver-builder.md).

:::caution Tip:
The responsive default heading and text styles that you can assign at
**Customize > General > Headings** and **Customize > General > Text** in the
Beaver Builder Theme apply as default settings in Beaver Builder and Beaver
Themer layouts, but they also apply as default settings to headings and text
in Gutenberg layouts, though they will not display until you preview or view
the page.

We think Beaver Builder is far superior to the features that Gutenberg offers,
but we encourage you to try Gutenberg and Beaver Builder for yourself. If you
have a Beaver Builder license, you can download the current version of Beaver
Builder from the [My Account](https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com/my-account/)
page, or you can install the free Beaver Builder Lite plugin.

Once you try both page builders side by side, we'd value your feedback on your
experience. The best mechanism to get feedback directly to us is to [submit a Support ticket](https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com/beaver-builder-support/).
