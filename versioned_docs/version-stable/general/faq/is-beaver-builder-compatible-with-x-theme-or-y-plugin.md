We do our best to make sure Beaver Builder is compatible with as many other
plugins and themes as possible. The best way to test Beaver Builder with your
plugin stack is to try installing [Beaver Builder Lite, which is
free.](https://wordpress.org/plugins/beaver-builder-lite-version/)

You have 30 days to try out any premium version after purchase, and if for any
reason Beaver Builder doesnâ€™t work with your theme or plugin, our Support team
will work with you to see what can be done!

Here's a list of [known incompatibilities](/beaver-builder/troubleshooting/debugging/known-beaver-builder-incompatibilities.md/#themes).
