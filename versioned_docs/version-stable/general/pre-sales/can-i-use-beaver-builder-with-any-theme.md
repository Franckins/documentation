Beaver Builder has been developed to work with almost any theme. However,
there are some exceptions to this rule such as:

  * themes bundled with other page builders
  * themes designed to work with other page builders
  * themes that don't use the WordPress loop
  * a theme has its own version of jQuery  enqueued or hardcoded

If you're using a premium third-party theme, you could test it out by installing the Beaver Builder Lite version available from [WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/plugins/beaver-builder-lite-version/) to see if you encounter any issues. If you don't, then you shouldn't have any issues with a premium version of Beaver Builder.

We'd also like to point out that once you try Beaver Builder, and especially [the Beaver Themer add-on](https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com/beaver-themer/) to Beaver Builder, you may change your idea of what you want your theme to do. 

Beaver Builder builds beautiful layouts of [the content area of the page](/beaver-builder/getting-started/what-can-i-do-with-beaver-builder.md#plugin-vs-theme-vs-beaver-themer), including sidebars with widgets or other content. You can save your own [layout templates](/beaver-builder/layouts/templates/layout-templates-overview.md) or [individual rows, columns and modules](/beaver-builder/layouts/templates/save-a-row-column-or-module-for-reuse.md) for reuse elsewhere. 

Beaver Themer lets you essentially override your theme to build your own layouts for headers, footers, archive pages, single posts, page banners, and more. Beaver Themer gives you far more control than you could ever get with a theme. In fact, you may find yourself wanting a theme that is well coded for performance and then gets out of the way, rather than a theme that provides all the bells and whistles that were needed before page builders.

If you decide to change your theme, our [Beaver Builder framework theme](https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com/wordpress-framework-theme/) is fully integrated with Beaver Builder and comes with two of our premium versions, or you can choose from [other themes that are known to support Beaver Builder and Beaver Themer](/beaver-themer/management-compatibility/beaver-themer-supported-themes.md).
