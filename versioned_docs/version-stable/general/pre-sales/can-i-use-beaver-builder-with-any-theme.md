Beaver Builder has been developed to work with almost any theme. However,
there are some exceptions to this rule such as:

  * themes bundled with other page builders
  * themes designed to work with other page builders
  * theme doesn't use the WordPress loop
  * theme has enqueued or hardcoded its own version of jQuery

If you're using a premium third-party theme, you may want to try the Beaver
Builder lite version available from [WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/plugins/beaver-builder-lite-version/)
and see if you encounter any issues. If you don't, then you shouldn't have any
issues with the pro version of Beaver Builder.
