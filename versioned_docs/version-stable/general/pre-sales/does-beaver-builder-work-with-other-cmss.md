Beaver Builder is a page builder plugin for WordPress and therefore, is only
compatible with the WordPress CMS. The same goes for our BB Theme and Beaver
Themer.

You're free to fork the Beaver Builder lite version available from
[WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/plugins/beaver-builder-lite-version/)
and add your own support for other content management systems.
