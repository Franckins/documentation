There are three aspects to translations:

  * Using POT files to get the translatable text for translations into new languages
  * Getting a translated version of the Beaver Builder Plugin and Theme
  * Building multilingual websites

## POT files for new translations

To facilitate new translations, Beaver Theme's translatable text is provided
in a POT file at _bb-theme/languages/fl-automator.pot_.

## Translated versions of the Beaver Builder Plugin and Theme

The Beaver Builder Plugin and Theme are currently available in a number of
languages. Please visit the following links for an overview of which languages
Beaver Builder is currently translated in and how complete those translations
are.

  * [Beaver Builder Plugin](https://translate.wpbeaverbuilder.com/glotpress/projects/bb-plugin/)
  * [Beaver Builder Theme](https://translate.wpbeaverbuilder.com/glotpress/projects/bb-theme/)
  * [Beaver Themer](https://translate.wpbeaverbuilder.com/glotpress/projects/bb-theme-builder/)

We’re always looking to increase the number of available translations, so let
us know if you’re interested in helping and we’ll hook you up with a free year
of our Pro membership.

Beaver Builder is currently translated using GlotPress. To get access and
become a translator, please [contact us using this form](https://translate.wpbeaverbuilder.com/contact-the-administrator/).

## Building multilingual websites

There are various plugins that assist with translating your site, but there
are two that have specific integrations with Beaver Builder:

  * [TranslatePress](https://translatepress.com)  
See [this blog post](https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com/how-to-create-a-multilingual-wordpress-site/) for information about how to translate a Beaver Builder site using TranslatePress.

  * [WPML](https://wpml.org)  
For more information, see WPML's post on [How to build multilingual sites with Beaver Builder and WPML](https://wpml.org/documentation/plugins-compatibility/beaver-builder/?aid=83065&affiliate_key=OKuuAGLjyHp3) or watch their [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4RjUCdOtFk).
